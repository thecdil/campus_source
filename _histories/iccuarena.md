The Idaho Central Credit Union (ICCU) Arena opened in 2021 and replaced the Kibbie Dome as the home for men’s and women’s basketball. The \$51-million project reflects a collaborative effort between Opsis Architecture, Hastings & Chivetta, StructureCraft, and Hoffman Construction. Private donors and the state’s forest products industry contributed over \$35 million, with Idaho Central Credit Union providing \$10 million to secure naming rights. The construction used wood from the University of Idaho Experimental Forest and other Idaho timber companies, showcasing local resources and craftsmanship. The arena serves as a “living laboratory” for students in architecture and natural resources and has earned awards for its design, sustainability, and innovative use of wood.[^1]

### Design

The ICCU Arena features a bold Contemporary style highlighted by a sweeping roof that echoes the forms of the Palouse hills. The structure uses a hybrid system of mass timber, steel, and concrete to support 854 glulam beams that weigh 442 tons and span 58 feet. The roof’s free-form geometry consists of more than 400 prefabricated plywood panels that also function as a bracing system. Sustainability guided the design, with cross-laminated timber, locally sourced cedar, and over two million board feet of Idaho wood integrated throughout.[^2]

### Physical Description

The arena covers 67,000 square feet and seats more than 4,000 spectators. The interior contains multi-use courts, coaching offices, locker rooms, and a premium club area. The exterior combines charcoal-stained cedar, glass curtain walls, and raw concrete, pairing natural materials with industrial elements. The roof cantilevers over the west entrance and then divides into overlapping contours toward the east, where it wraps to ground level. Vertical wood accents, glazed panels, and clean metal details define its contemporary appearance. Surrounded by campus greenery, the ICCU Arena stands as a landmark of innovation and Idaho identity.[^3].
