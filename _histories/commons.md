The Idaho Student Union Building (ISUB), formerly known as Idaho Commons, was designed in 1996, completed in 1999, and opened in 2000. Serving as a central hub for campus life, it functions as a gathering space for students and faculty, with the universityâ€™s relocation of the Student Union from the current Bruce M. Pitman Center prompting the change in name. The facility includes four floors, with a food court on the lowest level open to all upper levels.

The building is a semi-detached, irregular form of 78,000 square feet. Its exterior features red stretcher-bond brick, precast concrete panels, and floor-to-ceiling windows on several faces. A circular rotunda entrance adjoins a large glass atrium. Windows have fixed sashes, plain trim, and no sills; doors are glass with metal frames and visually consistent with the fenestration. The roof is flat.
