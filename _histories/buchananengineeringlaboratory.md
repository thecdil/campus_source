title: Buchanan Engineering Laboratory
---

The J.E. Buchanan Engineering Building (BEL) was developed in response to a directive from the Idaho State Legislature to alleviate overcrowding at the College of Engineering, which by 1966 had grown to 860 students. Its 80,000 square feet of space—housing departmental offices and laboratories for chemical, civil, electrical, and agricultural engineering—effectively doubled the college’s campus footprint overnight. The building supported instruction in eight engineering specializations and was designed to meet the evolving demands of the Cold War-era engineering profession. University regents named the new facility in honor of Jesse E. Buchanan, a distinguished alumnus who served as Dean of Engineering (1938–1946) and President of the University (1946–1954). Buchanan was also the first University of Idaho student to complete four years with a perfect GPA, earning lasting distinction. Upon opening, the BEL played a key role in expanding regional capacity for engineering education, with nearly 80 percent of graduates entering the workforce in the American West.

The building is a 3.5-story, rectangular-form International Style structure featuring three primary floors, a smaller penthouse level, and a partially below-grade lower level. Exposed steel-reinforced concrete columns and beams rest on a smooth-dressed concrete foundation. Following a Miesian approach, the first floor is recessed behind vertical piers along the north, east, and south elevations, giving the upper floors a suspended appearance. Fenestration includes horizontal bands of untrimmed aluminum-frame windows at the second and third stories and floor-to-ceiling glazing at the first floor. Window-bracketing sections of stretcher-bond red brick are inlaid within the concrete frame, visually connecting the building to earlier campus architecture. Interior finishes include painted cinder-block walls, exposed structural elements, asphalt-asbestos tile, and wood-paneled doors. These materials reinforce the BEL’s functional, minimalist character and its alignment with the “form-follows-function” ethos of postwar Modernism.
