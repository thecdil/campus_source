The J.E. Buchanan Engineering Building (BEL) was developed in response to a directive from the Idaho State Legislature to alleviate overcrowding at the College of Engineering, which by 1966 had grown to 860 students. With 80,000 square feet of space housing departmental offices and laboratories for chemical, civil, electrical, and agricultural engineering, the building effectively doubled the college’s campus footprint overnight. It supported instruction in eight engineering specializations and was designed to meet the evolving demands of the Cold War-era engineering profession. The facility was named in honor of Jesse E. Buchanan, a distinguished alumnus who served as Dean of Engineering (1938–1946) and President of the University (1946–1954). Upon opening, the BEL played a key role in expanding regional capacity for engineering education, with nearly 80 percent of graduates entering the workforce in the American West.[1]
### Design

Designed in the International Style, the Buchanan Engineering Building reflects postwar Modernist principles. Its steel-reinforced concrete frame, exposed structural system, and minimal ornamentation express a functional aesthetic. The design follows a Miesian approach, with the first floor recessed behind vertical piers along the north, east, and south elevations, giving the upper stories a suspended appearance. Materials and finishes throughout the building reinforce its commitment to function and efficiency, hallmarks of mid-century institutional architecture.[2]
### Physical Description

The 3.5-story, rectangular-form building includes three primary floors, a smaller penthouse level, and a partially below-grade lower level. Exposed steel-reinforced concrete columns and beams rest on a smooth-dressed concrete foundation. Fenestration consists of horizontal bands of untrimmed aluminum-frame windows at the second and third stories and floor-to-ceiling glazing at the first floor. Stretcher-bond red brick panels inlaid within the concrete frame visually link the BEL to earlier campus architecture. Interior features include painted cinder-block walls, exposed structural elements, asphalt-asbestos tile, and wood-paneled doors, contributing to the building’s utilitarian character and the “form-follows-function” ethos of its era.[3]

Jesse Everett Buchanan (1904–1986) was a distinguished alumnus of the University of Idaho, earning his B.S. in Civil Engineering in 1927—the first engineering student to graduate with a perfect 4.0 GPA—and later completing his M.S. in 1929. He served as Dean of Engineering from 1938 to 1942 and as the University’s tenth president from 1946 to 1954, guiding the institution through a period of significant expansion. During his presidency, Buchanan secured national accreditation, increased faculty and enrollment, and oversaw major campus building initiatives. He went on to lead the Asphalt Institute as president for 15 years, promoting innovation in the highway materials field and solidifying his legacy as both an educator and industry leader.[4][5]
