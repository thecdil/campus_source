title: Buchanan Engineering Laboratory
---

The J.E. Buchanan Engineering Building (BEL) was developed in response to a directive from the Idaho State Legislature to alleviate overcrowding at the College of Engineering, which by 1966 had grown to 860 students. With 80,000 square feet of space housing departmental offices and laboratories for chemical, civil, electrical, and agricultural engineering, the building effectively doubled the college’s campus footprint overnight.[^1] It supported instruction in eight engineering specializations and was designed to meet the evolving demands of the Cold War-era engineering profession.[^2] The facility was named in honor of Jesse E. Buchanan, a distinguished alumnus who served as Dean of Engineering (1938–1946) and President of the University (1946–1954).[^3] The BEL was responsible for expanding regional capacity for engineering education at the time, producing a significant contribution to the workforce in the American West.[^4]  

### Design
The Buchanan Engineering Building showcases International Style through its postwar Modernist qualities. The steel-reinforced concrete frame, exposed structural system, and minimal ornamentation express a functional aesthetic. The design follows a Miesian approach, with the first floor recessed behind vertical piers along the north, east, and south elevations, giving the upper stories a suspended appearance.[^5] The commitment to functionality and efficency demonstrated by design of building are reflected in material choices and finishes throughout–typical of mid-century institutional architecture.[^6] 

### Physical Description
The 3.5-story, rectangular-form building includes three primary floors, a smaller penthouse level, and a partially below-grade lower level. Exposed steel-reinforced concrete columns and beams rest on a smooth-dressed concrete foundation. The fenestration consists of horizontal bands of untrimmed aluminum-frame windows on the upper floors and floor-to-ceiling glazing at the first level. The inclusion of red brick panels integrated in the concrete frame visually links the BEL to earlier campus architecture. The interior is largely utilitarian, staying true to the “form-follows-function” ethos of its era.[^7]

In 1927, Jesse Everett Buchanan (1904–1986) earned his B.S. in Civil Engineering from the University of Idaho. He was the first engineering student to graduate with a perfect 4.0 GPA. He later completed his M.S. in 1929. He served as Dean of Engineering from 1938 to 1942 and as the University’s tenth president from 1946 to 1954, guiding the institution through a period of significant expansion. During his presidency, Buchanan secured national accreditation, increased faculty and enrollment, and oversaw major campus building initiatives. He went on to lead the Asphalt Institute as president for 15 years, promoting innovation in the highway materials field and solidifying his legacy as both an educator and industry leader.[^8][^9]
