title: Campus Architecture
---

The buildings and landscapes that make up the University of Idaho campus are the result of a long and layered architectural history. Each era of building and growth builds on the visual and functional cues of its predecessors. At the outset, early 20th-century revival styles such as Renaissance, Romanesque, and Classical Revival planted the seeds that would become a formal red brick theme—a motif that would set the standard for campus building design for the next century and beyond.

From the 1920s through the 1950s, these revival styles evolved into the well-known presence of Collegiate Gothic, reinforcing the aesthetic identity of the campus. These Collegiate Gothic buildings created an academic core surrounding the Administration Lawn, a plan put in place by the Olmsted Brothers. While this plan has been altered and modified over the years, its creation has significantly impacted campus planning and the resulting built environment.

From the 1930s through World War II, student growth persisted despite financial constraints, ushering in a new era of efficiency and functionality. These Minimal Traditional, Modern, and International Style buildings used new materials and methods while maintaining campus continuity.

Following the postwar crunch, mid-century creativity abounded with Brutalist, Postmodern, and Contemporary buildings. Despite their experimental scale and form, they often utilized the same pressed red brick building materials, keeping a contextually unified look. Newer landmarks, such as the entrance signs, echo the classic University of Idaho Gothic silhouette, nodding to the campus’s early 20th-century origins.

Taken together, these changing waves of design and style map out the evolution of the University of Idaho’s built environment—tracing the various ways that architectural shifts reflect changing educational priorities, student growth, and societal trends. While many of these different categories have some overlap in time, the general progression from early 20th-century Revival through late 20th- to 21st-century Postmodern and Contemporary styles is clear, providing a comprehensive architectural history of campus life.
