title: I Tank (New)
---

The I Tank is recognized across campus and the wider region as a cultural landmark and long-standing symbol of university spirit. Since its installation in 1952, it has served as a rallying point for student life—especially around fraternity pledging and spirited “raids” before football games. Its bold black and gold “I” has made it an enduring feature of campus identity and community traditions.

Set on an open lawn near the University President’s Residence, the tank holds 500,000 gallons and is ellipsoidal in shape. With Shattuck Arboretum to the west and the Botanical Gardens to the east, it rises prominently above the surrounding landscape and is visible from many directions due to its size, height, and distinctive university colors.
