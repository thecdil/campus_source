### History

Recognized across campus and the wider region as a cultural landmark, the I Tank has been a long-standing symbol of university spirit since its installation in 1952. From its earliest years, the tank became a focal point for student traditions, serving as a rallying spot for fraternity pledging and spirited “raids” leading up to football games. Its presence, coupled with the bold black and gold “I” painted on its side, has helped anchor campus identity and foster a sense of shared community through generations of students and alumni.[^1]



### Design

The I Tank was designed as a utilitarian water storage structure but has taken on a symbolic role far beyond its original function. Its ellipsoidal shape, combined with the striking university colors painted on its surface, transforms an industrial object into an emblem of school pride. The simplicity of its form allows the large “I” to stand out dramatically against the landscape, reinforcing its status as a campus icon.[^2]



### Physical Description

Set on an open lawn near the University President’s Residence, the I Tank holds 500,000 gallons and rises prominently above its surroundings. The Shattuck Arboretum lies to the west, while the Botanical Gardens stretch to the east, framing the tank within a setting of greenery. Visible from many directions due to its size, height, and distinctive black-and-gold markings, the I Tank remains one of the most recognizable features on the University of Idaho campus.[^3]
