### Academic Mall 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="campus00770" %}

The Academic Mall has long served as a central pedestrian artery at the University of Idaho, linking key academic buildings, residence halls, the library, and the ISUB. Its development paralleled the university’s own growth, gradually taking shape as enrollment rose and departments expanded. The opening of Chrisman Hall in 1939, followed by the Agricultural Science Building in 1951, marked early moments in the mall’s emergence as a defined space. Later additions such as the Agricultural Biotechnology Building in 2000 and the IRIC Building in 2016 extended its reach. The university’s Long-Range Campus Development Plan emphasizes the mall as both a practical and symbolic element of the campus—supporting research, learning, and daily life while reinforcing a broader commitment to community and the natural environment.[^1]

### Design

Framed by major academic and administrative buildings, the mall forms a vital connection between the campus core and prominent structures like the Memorial Gym, Art & Architecture South, and the Administration Building. It reflects a vision of landscape architecture that supports both circulation and community gathering. The space is intentionally car-free, reinforcing its role as a safe and welcoming pedestrian zone at the heart of campus life.[^2]

### Physical Description 

The mall features interlocking paved walkways bordered by lawns, mature trees, and low plantings. These pathways weave between buildings and open greens used for studying, relaxing, and hosting events. The space encourages movement through the academic and social core of campus while maintaining the feel of a calm, verdant commons.[^3]

### Vandal Healing Garden

The Vandal Healing Garden and Memorial emerged in response to the tragic events of November 13, 2022, when four University of Idaho students—Ethan Chapin, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle, and Kaylee Goncalves—were murdered just south of campus. In the aftermath, the College of Art & Architecture proposed a project to honor their lives and the lives of all students who have passed away while enrolled at the university. A community design workshop in September 2023 produced a vision for an interactive space fostering both group gathering and individual reflection. Funded by $285,000 in donations, the project was realized through student labor during the summer of 2024. Participants worked without pay or credit, exemplifying the university’s spirit of solidarity and service. Architecture student Jackson Wiedenfeld reflected, “I wouldn’t change it for anything.” The university dedicated the memorial on August 21, 2024, at the former site of MacLean Field.[^4] 

### Design

The site was conceived as a dual-purpose space for communal remembrance and private contemplation. A circular pavilion anchors the northern end of the garden, offering a covered area for gathering. The southern section, known as the “healing walk,” integrates natural landscaping and seating along a gently curving path. Materials and plantings were chosen for both their symbolism and connection to campus—many were repurposed or salvaged, linking the memorial to broader themes of renewal and memory.[5]

### Physical Description

Rectangular in shape and oriented north to south, the site measures approximately 190 by 100 feet. At its center, a steel-framed pavilion with a metal roof shelters a mosaic sculpture commemorating students who died while enrolled. A circular concrete path and wooden benches frame the space. Nearby, a small steel booth holds message containers for visitors. The healing walk features a landscaped berm and a curved pathway planted with dogwood, maple, hydrangea, and evergreens. A bench made of black locust wood—salvaged from a fallen campus tree and ICCU Arena remnants—offers a quiet spot for reflection. To the south, a 20-foot steel-faced light stands on the hillside, described by Dean of Students Blain Eckles as “a beacon of light and hope.”[6]
