title: Executive Residence (new)
---

The Executive Residence serves as the official home of the sitting president of the University of Idaho. Since the tenure of Ernest W. Hartung (1965–1977), university presidents have resided on campus. The current residence replaced a raised ranch-style house from 1966. Portions of the original home including its garage, fireplace, and foundation were thoughtfully incorporated into the new structure. Salvaged materials such as beams and black locust wood from the original house were repurposed in the interior. Larch flooring was milled using wood from the University of Illinois' *Experimental Forest* by their student logging crew.[^1] 

The design of the residence features a central open floor plan that visually connects the home to both the Shattuck Arboretum and the Arboretum and Botanical Garden. In addition to being a private residence, the Executive Residence functions as a social venue, designed to accommodate formal dinners and larger receptions of 40–50 guests.[^2]

### Design

The residence exhibits a 21st-century Modern aesthetic characterized by an irregular form and asymmetrical façades clad in black wood and metal siding. Privacy without sacrificing visual territory is valued in this residence, as most of the windows are hidden from the road, while still offering expansive views of the campus and the Palouse beyond.[^3]

### Physical Description

The 6,000-square-foot, three-level residence is crowned by a medium-gable roof with a shed-style extension at the east end. The siding flows seamlessly from exterior to interior, integrating with large dormer windows and maintaining visual continuity throughout the structure.[^4]
