title: Executive Residence (new)
---

The Executive Residence serves as the official home of the sitting president of the University of Idaho. Since the tenure of Ernest W. Hartung (1965–1977), university presidents have resided on campus. The current residence replaced a raised ranch-style house from 1966, though portions of the original home—including its garage, fireplace, and foundation—were thoughtfully incorporated into the new structure. Salvaged materials such as glulam beams and black locust wood from the nearby site were repurposed in the interior. Larch flooring milled by the University of Illinois’ student logging crew and a central open floor plan visually connect the home to both the Shattuck Arboretum and the Arboretum and Botanical Garden. The collaborative design-build process yielded both budget efficiency and design synergy. In addition to being a private residence, the Executive Residence functions as a social venue, designed to accommodate formal dinners and larger receptions of 40–50 guests.[^1]

### Design
The residence exhibits a 21st-century Modern aesthetic characterized by an irregular form and asymmetrical facades clad in black wood and metal siding. Vertically oriented windows and multiple glass and metal doors provide light and access. The south entrance is situated beneath a projecting balcony, while the north elevation features large rectangular volumes with expansive sash windows framed by metal mullions.[^2]

### Physical Description
The 6,000-square-foot, three-level residence is crowned by a medium-gable roof with a shed-style extension at the east end. The siding flows seamlessly from exterior to interior, integrating with large dormer windows and maintaining visual continuity throughout the structure.[^3]
