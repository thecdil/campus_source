title: Lionel Hampton Music Building
---

Originally named the Music Building, this facility was renamed in 1987 in honor of jazz legend Lionel Hampton, making it the first school of music in the United States named after a jazz musician—and the only one named after an African American jazz musician. Historically, the building served as an educational and performance space for student musicians and remains a central venue for the university’s musical instruction and cultural life. Since 1967, it has also hosted workshops and concerts during the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival, which began as the largest education-based jazz festival in the country. Hampton, moved by the university’s dedication to music education, pledged his support to help further jazz instruction and performance.

The structure rises four stories and is rectangular in form, constructed of reinforced concrete with a pitched roof and brick masonry laid in stretcher bond. Gothic-style elements include dramatic arched stone entryways, grouped grid windows, and ornamental lanterns. Windows are multi-sash and often arranged in sets of three, separated by narrow spacing. Entrances are accentuated with wood and metal doors framed in stone and surrounded by vertical rectangular windows, reflecting a late example of Collegiate Gothic design on campus.
