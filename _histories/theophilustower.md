Theophilus Tower, completed in 1969 and designed by the Idaho architectural firm Dropping & Kelley, was named in honor of former university president Donald R. Theophilus and commissioned during the administration of President Ernest Hartung. As the tallest occupiable structure in Moscow at the time, the building provided housing for over 350 students and remains the only high-rise tower on the University of Idaho campus. Its construction marked a bold visual and institutional statement, reflecting the university’s mid-century expansion and Dr. Theophilus’s lasting influence on campus development.

The twelve-story tower follows an elongated cruciform plan with eleven stories above grade and a basement. Steel-reinforced concrete and brick masonry infill give the structure a robust, durable presence, and its red brick veneer—laid in continuous running stretcher bond—reinforces the campus motif. The exterior is defined by large, flat-brick corner masses and vertical concrete window columns that frame a strict grid of rectangular, double-sash windows across all upper floors. The flat roof includes a recessed maintenance level. The primary entrance on the south façade features a triple set of metal-framed doors with doorlight panels, transoms, and sidelights. Theophilus Tower’s commanding height and rational form, along with its minimal detailing and strong vertical expression, contribute to its distinct presence within the campus landscape.
