title: Administration Lawn, Olmstead Green
---

The Administration Lawn was conceptualized in 1908 by John C. Olmsted of the renowned landscape architecture firm Olmsted Brothers. In his report to University of Idaho President James MacLean, Olmsted referred to the area as “Center Campus,” underscoring its intended role as the university’s central green space. It remains the only surviving component of Olmsted’s original campus plan.

A prominent feature of the lawn is the Presidential Grove, a commemorative space that began in 1911 when former President Theodore Roosevelt visited the university and planted a tree. The tradition continued with additional plantings by notable figures, including President William Taft, Vice President Charles Curtis—the only Native American to serve in that role—and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Each tree includes a dedication plaque memorializing the occasion.  

### Design
Olmsted envisioned a central lawn that would serve as a communal and symbolic heart of the university. Over time, additional elements were introduced to enhance the space’s ceremonial and educational value, such as labeled trees planted by academic departments and commemorative benches donated by alumni and community members.  

### Physical Description
The eleven-acre lawn features a network of concrete pathways running east-west and north-south, with a stairway extending to the northeast toward Hello Walk, a tree-lined promenade leading to the Administration Building. The site is covered primarily in grass and dotted with mature trees arranged both along walkways and in more vernacular groupings. Notable features include a Spanish-American War Memorial Statue honoring University of Idaho students, remnants of a historic maple grove, historic tennis courts, and the tree-lined Presidential Grove at the lawn’s southern edge. More recent tree plantings, dating from the 1990s to the present, are identified with departmental signage.
