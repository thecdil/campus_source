Steel House is a women's co-operative dormitory. <a href="/digital/campus/buildings/blakehouse.html">Blake House</a>, currently an office building for music and other faculty members, was historically occupied by Steel House.  In 2007, due to high renovation costs, Steel House was closed. In limbo for a year, the Steel House found new homes in the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity house from 2009 to 2012, and the Delta Chi house Fall 2012 to the present.

Commonly referred to as "Steel," the women's co-operative was named after Ethel Steel who was a leader in the movement to provide cooperative residence halls on UI's campus and a member of the board of regents at the University of Idaho from 1933 to 1946. Women living in the residence became known as the "Women of Steel" or "Steelies".
