The Agricultural Biotechnology Building at the University of Idaho underscores the institution’s enduring commitment to agricultural research and education. “This is one of the most important things we will do in the 21st century in terms of this university,” said President Robert Hoover. Designed to support disciplines such as plant and soil science, entomology, animal and veterinary sciences, microbiology, molecular biology, and biochemistry, the facility integrates modular laboratories, classrooms, and offices to advance the university’s academic mission. Construction began in 1998 and concluded in 2001, marking the final major project of the 20th-century campus building boom. The $24.5 million project received more than $6 million in federal funding, $5.3 million from the state, $3 million in private donations, and $1.3 million from other sources, including the Idaho Wheat Commission, which also advocated for the inclusion of strawboard—a wheat byproduct—in at least one conference room. Occupying the last vacant site on the Academic Mall, the building represented a strategic investment in the future of agricultural innovation.

The 48,000-square-foot, 3.5-story building is a Contemporary design emphasizing rectilinear forms with Neo Deco-inspired elements. It is composed of steel-reinforced concrete, red-pressed brick, glass, and metal paneling, and features contrasting green tile—a material unique on campus. The east elevation showcases a central projection highlighted by horizontal fenestration bands vertically divided by twin buttresses and clad in green tile. Dual-paned, metal-framed windows and standard ADA-compliant glass-inset metal doors appear throughout. The north and west facades are marked by unornamented bands of sash windows with flush-light transoms, while the south elevation connects to the Agricultural Sciences Building. Red brick imparts a sense of collegiate continuity, while the green tile and varied projections anchor the structure firmly in 21st-century design.
