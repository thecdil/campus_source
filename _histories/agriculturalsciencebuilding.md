The E.J. Iddings Agricultural Science Building, originally known as the Agricultural Sciences Building, opened in 1951 in response to rising enrollment and an urgent need for office and lab space. Enrollment in the university’s four-year agricultural science program had more than tripled between 1916 and 1946, reflecting agriculture’s dominant role in Idaho’s economy during the mid-20th century. In 1945 alone, the state’s net agricultural income reached $193.8 million—far surpassing revenue from mining or forestry. [1]

### Design
Designed by Boise architect Victor Jones, the building supported the expansion of the College of Agriculture with updated classrooms, labs, and faculty space. By the 1970s, demand again outpaced capacity, prompting the addition of a large north and west wing in 1974, designed by Bellamy, Bratvold, and Carpenter. The structure was rededicated at that time in honor of longtime dean E.J. Iddings. [2]

### Physical Description
The original building is a four-story, reinforced concrete structure with a flat roof and stretcher bond brick veneer. Long horizontal ribbon windows and minimal ornamentation reflect International Style influences. A large auditorium projects from the south end. The 1970s addition nearly doubled the usable space and echoes the original materials while introducing recessed entries and tall brick-clad columns with vertical window groupings.[3]

 The east elevation features stacked window bands and a prominent bas-relief of an early 20th-century agricultural scene. Entrances are primarily aluminum-framed glass doors set beneath modest awnings or galleries. An enclosed skywalk at the building’s north end connects it to the nearby Agricultural Biotechnology building, reinforcing the structure’s continuing role in the evolving agricultural sciences complex.[4]
  
### E. J. Iddings
![E.J. Iddings Among vegetation.](https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/iddings/spec_ji383.jpg)
  
  Edward John Iddings (1879–1954) was a foundational figure in Idaho’s agricultural education. He served as Dean of the University of Idaho’s College of Agriculture from 1915 to 1946, helping to shape the college during a period of major growth and change. Raised on a 350-acre farm in Indiana, Iddings earned degrees from Colorado Agricultural College (Now Colorado State University) and worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture before joining the faculty of the University of Idaho in 1910.  
  
  His legacy is honored in the E.J. Iddings Agricultural Science Building, which has carried that name since 1974. His career and contributions are preserved in four scrapbooks housed at the University of Idaho Library, offering insight into the evolution of agriculture and education in the state.[5]
