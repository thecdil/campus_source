title: University Hut (U-Hut)

Initially called the Y-Hut, the U-Hut was built by the National War Work Council of YMCA and intended for student soldiers. It was dedicated on February 9, 1919. The English department began performing plays in its small auditorium 12 days after the dedication. 

In 1923, the University took full possession of the building and renamed it the U-Hut, to be used as a laboratory theater for the English department’s drama courses and for the Varsity Players, the campus theatre group. By this time, the ASUI also had offices there. A used bookstore briefly occupied the offices after ASUI moved out. 

In 1926, a post office substation was put in the northern part of the building then moved to the new library when it was completed in 1957. 

In 1936, the building’s basement was enlarged and housed the university storeroom, the student post office, part of the Art Department, and an office space for the Department of Buildings and Grounds. Additionally, the Art Department had a studio on the second floor.

By 1966, the building was solely occupied by the Theatre Arts department. In 1979, the U-Hut’s black box theatre was renamed the Collette Theatre for professor and department chair Jean Collette. 

In 1988, the Theatre Department was moved out. The U-Hut became the Idaho Commons construction headquarters and was then demolished. [^1]
