### Vandal Golf Course 

The University of Idaho golf course, located west and southwest of the main campus, traces its roots to student interest in the late 1920s. A makeshift course was first constructed in 1930 by university workmen to meet growing demand, despite the belief that golf was largely a sport of the wealthy. In 1936, the university invested $130,000—financed by student fees over fifteen years—to purchase land and construct a formal nine-hole course. The project was one of the few Depression-era construction efforts in Moscow and reflected a commitment to student recreation. The course was designed and overseen by golf architect Francis L. (Frank) James, who had previously worked on courses in Moscow and at Washington State College. He later served as both course manager and resident golf professional until his death in 1952. A memorial plaque in the clubhouse honors his legacy. The course gained prominence in 1959 when the Vandal golf team won the Northern Pacific Coast Conference Championship.[1]   

### Design
In the late 1960s, retired professional golfer Bob E. Baldock of Newport Beach, California, was hired to redesign the course and expand it to 18 holes. Baldock had designed other regional courses and brought a strong understanding of landscape-driven design. His approach emphasized the site's natural topography—valleys, hills, and bowls—which he considered ideal for golf. The remodel, estimated at $145,000, required acquiring 70 additional acres of nearby farmland, some of which had been used for wheat cultivation in the preceding decade. Baldock also lengthened tee boxes to better accommodate collegiate-level play. University Dean Charles Decker managed the project, with on-site supervision by Harry Seeman.[2]   

### Physical Description
Today, the 18-hole course occupies rolling terrain shaped by Baldock’s vision, integrating natural landforms into the play experience. The course includes extended tees and reshaped fairways designed to enhance both challenge and visual appeal. The layout supports flexible course management practices, such as rotating pin locations. While minor changes have occurred over time, the course’s character has remained consistent since the 1960s expansion, continuing to serve the university and wider community as a unique landscape resource.[3]  

### ASUI Golf Course Clubhouse
The ASUI Golf Course Clubhouse is closely tied to the development of the University of Idaho’s golf program. Efforts to establish a course began in 1926 after sustained advocacy by English professor and avid golfer George Morey Miller, Ph.D. The first course, located east of campus, was designed by renowned English golf course architect Francis L. James, credited with more than a hundred greens across the United States. In 1935, the university acquired land adjacent to the arboretum and again enlisted James to design a new course. He was later hired as coach and course manager. After his death, the university named the clubhouse in his honor and installed a commemorative plaque. The post-WWII golf boom reinforced the course’s significance, mirroring a national trend of expanding athletic offerings at universities.[4]

### Design
Completed in 1969, the current ASUI Golf Course Clubhouse was designed by Boise architects Clin, Smull Hamill, Shaw, and Assoc. to replace the original Frank L. James Memorial Clubhouse and caretaker’s cottage. The single-story, post-and-beam structure reflects a mid-century aesthetic, with visual cues from the atomic ranch style. A breezeway connects three functional segments—restaurant, pro shop, and offices—providing sheltered circulation while separating uses. Exposed beam ends and a low-slung gable roof reinforce the building’s modernist character. Large windows, primarily oriented toward the golf course, offer territorial views and anchor the building in its landscape. These expansive glazed areas highlight views of the course and enhance the building’s indoor-outdoor relationship.[5]


### Physical Description
The clubhouse is timber-framed on a concrete foundation, clad in vertically oriented wood paneling painted to match the original finish. It has an intersecting open gable roof, currently surfaced with asphalt or composition shingles. Exterior doors are metal with updated locks and are distributed across all three segments. The breezeway-facing double doors serve as the primary access points to each section, with additional doors providing entry to the golf cart lot, restaurant patio, and kitchen.[6]

Windows are concentrated on the south- and east-facing elevations and include both wood and metal units. The office and pro shop wings feature rows of rectangular windows, while the gabled ends of the restaurant display large rectangular windows beneath triangular and trapezoidal clerestories.[7] 

### Francis L. James  
![placeholder image for Frank L. James](https://bcgolfhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/james.jpg)  
Frank L. James was a British-born golf course designer whose career left a lasting mark on North American golf architecture. Known for designing more than 100 courses, he was widely respected for his ability to integrate natural landscapes into his layouts. His work at the University of Idaho began in 1926 when he designed the university’s first golf course east of campus. In 1935, he returned to design a new course adjacent to the arboretum, which remains the university’s course today. James was later hired as coach and course manager. Following his death, the original campus clubhouse was named in his honor, commemorating both his contributions to Idaho and his standing in the larger golfing world.[8]
