The original Administration Building, constructed in 1892 is commonly known as the Old Admin. It was the centerpiece of the University of Idaho during its early years. Built by G.W. Babcock of Walla Walla, Washington, the building was designed in the Gothic Revival style and quickly became known as “the most attractive building in Idaho,” according to the 1893–94 University Catalog.[^1] It housed classrooms, the university library, and administrative offices, and by 1896, it hosted the university’s first commencement ceremony for four graduates. 

Tragically, in the early morning hours of March 30, 1906, the building was engulfed in flames. Though some cherished items were rescued including the “Silver and Gold Book,” a jeweled gift from the women of Moscow, and a stuffed mountain goat, the fire claimed most of the university’s library collection which had been carefully organized by Miss Belle Sweet, the university librarian. 

Dean Jay Glover Eldridge famously climbed a ladder into his office and threw drawers of documents to Judge Roland Hodgins (pioneer and proprietor of Hodgin's Drug Store), who collected them where they landed. President James A. MacLean, also a volunteer firefighter, could do little but watch as the central structure of the campus was reduced to [blackened skeletal walls and wet rubble](/digital/campus/items/campus02111.html). Although arson was suspected, no culprit was ever identified. 

The destruction of the building was a blow to both the university and the community of Moscow. The Lewiston Morning Tribune sought to console its readers, predicting, “To many it will seem like the university is gone—but not so. Upon the ruins will rise a statelier edifice, and with it a new and larger era in the university life.” [^2] In the aftermath, classes and offices were relocated around town. Insurance funds were received, but they fell short of covering a full replacement. President MacLean proposed building Morrill Hall, dedicated to agriculture, as a temporary central building until a new administration building could be constructed. 

Three years later, in 1909, the central section of what is now called the New Administration Building was completed. This new structure would become an enduring symbol of both the University of Idaho and Gothic Revival architecture in the state. [^3] 

In 1932, to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the university, President Mervin G. Neale and Congressman (and UI alumnus) Burton French led the recovery of surviving stones from the Old Admin. That same year, a student competition was held to design a memorial using the salvaged stonework. The winning design, submitted by Jedd Jones of Malad, Idaho, became what we now know as the [Memorial Steps](/digital/campus/items/campus03039.html). These steps, just south of the [New Admin](/digital/campus/buildings/administrationbuildingnew.html) building, are tribute to the university’s early years and enduring spirit.[^4]

### Design

Constructed in a U-shaped plan similar to its successor ([the New Admin](/digital/campus/buildings/administrationbuildingnew.html)), the Old Administration Building was consisting of a main section flanked by East and West wings. Its Gothic Revival design (sometimes referred to as _Picturesque Gothic_) featured a memorable Gothic silhouette, with pointed arches, steeply pitched roofs, and a dramatic vertical emphasis. The central section included a 168-foot steeple, giving the building a commanding presence on campus.[^5] 

As described in the 1901–02 University Catalog, the building’s amenities were “commodious,” and its plumbing was supplied with artesian water. The symmetrical wings and grand scale reflected a sense of permanence and optimism appropriate for a newly established land-grant institution aiming to shape the future of Idaho.

### Physical Description

The Old Admin building was three stories tall, in addition to a full basement. The exterior was red pressed brick and its interior woodwork was crafted from California redwood and native tamarack. The most prominent feature of the building was a central steeple rising 168 feet above ground level. The Gothic Revival style was reflected in the building’s overall form and architectural details, reinforcing its identity as a place of scholarship and civic pride.[^6] 

After the fire, the site was cleared for new construction. All the burnt remains of masonry, stone, and concrete were buried or hauled away, with the exception of the main steps. Of what was salvageable from those steps, several stone fragments were preserved. They were later repurposed in the commemorative landscape feature now known as the [Memorial Steps](/digital/campus/items/campus03039.html). [^7] These materials, integrated into the landscape south of the current Administration Building, provide a physical and symbolic connection to the university’s origins and its resilience in the face of loss.
