Commonly known as “Mem Gym,” the Memorial Gymnasium was built in 1929 to honor all Idahoans who lost their lives in World War I. Designed by University of Idaho architect and faculty member David C. Lange—with contributions from other UI faculty—the building is a unique reflection of both reverence and creativity. From the beginning, it served not only as a memorial but also as a key venue for university life, functioning as a 2,500-seat gymnasium and physical education facility.

Throughout its history, Mem Gym has hosted numerous landmark events, including a 1938 lecture by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. For decades, it was the university’s largest indoor gathering space, accommodating commencements, concerts, and major campus functions until the construction of the Kibbie Dome in the 1970s. Its enduring legacy and rich cultural significance earned it a place on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977—an unusually early designation for a building just 49 years old.

Quirky and architecturally distinctive, the gym’s exterior blends Tudor Collegiate Gothic with Art Deco elements. Its red brick façade is accented with cast stone, diamond-patterned brickwork, and Gothic window bays framed by stained glass. Playful “leatherhead” football player gargoyles line the window frames and walls, adding personality to its solemn purpose. One of its most eye-catching features is an octagonal tower with finials and a pagoda-style domed roof—an eclectic nod to the experimental design sensibilities of the late 1920s. A west-end addition, completed in 1952, adhered closely to the original design, preserving the building’s striking architectural character.
