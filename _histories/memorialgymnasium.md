### History

Commonly known as “Mem Gym,” the Memorial Gymnasium was built in 1929 to honor all Idahoans who lost their lives in World War I. University of Idaho architect and faculty member David C. Lange designed the building, with contributions from other UI faculty. The gymnasium served not only as a memorial but also as a key venue for university life, functioning as a 2,500-seat gymnasium and physical education facility. Landmark events took place in Mem Gym, including a 1938 lecture by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. For decades, it remained the university’s largest indoor gathering space, hosting commencements, concerts, and major campus functions until the Kibbie Dome opened in the 1970s. The gym’s cultural significance led to its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, an unusually early designation for a building just 49 years old. [^1] 

### Design

The gym’s exterior blends Tudor Collegiate Gothic with Art Deco elements, resulting in a quirky and architecturally distinctive appearance. The red brick façade features cast stone accents, diamond-patterned brickwork, and Gothic window bays framed by stained glass. Decorative “leatherhead” football player gargoyles line the window frames and walls, adding character to the solemn purpose of the building. The design includes an octagonal tower crowned by finials and a pagoda-style domed roof, reflecting the experimental design sensibilities of the late 1920s. The west-end addition, completed in 1952, was designed to closely match the original architecture, preserving the building’s striking character. [^2] 

### Physical Description

The Memorial Gymnasium is a large, rectangular structure with a red brick exterior accented by cast stone and detailed brickwork. Gothic window bays with stained glass punctuate the façade. The octagonal tower rises prominently, topped with finials and a pagoda-style dome. Gargoyles depicting “leatherhead” football players decorate the walls and window surrounds. The 1952 addition on the west end maintains the original building’s architectural style and materials, ensuring a cohesive exterior appearance.[^3]
