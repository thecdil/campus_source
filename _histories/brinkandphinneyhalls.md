Carol Ryrie Brink Hall - 1937

As one of the first large residence halls on campus, Carol Ryrie Brink Hall (originally Willis Sweet Hall) played a key role in shaping student life at the University of Idaho. Its construction in the mid-1930s was part of a bold campus expansion made possible through a university-led bond program—an inventive solution to limited state funding during the Great Depression. Students housed here benefitted from a highly efficient kitchen that could serve full capacity in under three minutes, thanks to features like a 17-foot steam table and a soapless dishwashing system. The hall’s reputation for innovation drew national attention, prompting visits from other institutions hoping to study its design. The building also endured challenges, including a 1956 arson incident that caused significant damage. In 1982, it was renamed for author Carol Ryrie Brink, an Idaho native and university alumna known for writing vividly about her home state.

Defined by its blend of Collegiate Gothic style and Arts and Crafts influence, Brink Hall presents a modest yet distinctive profile. Its warm red brick exterior is punctuated by randomly placed clinker bricks and trimmed with pale Boise Sandstone, setting it apart from other campus structures. Large arched doorways, pointed gables, and evenly spaced windows contribute to its historic character without overwhelming the design. A newer elevator tower, added in 1999, integrates into the building’s overall form with minimal disruption. Visual rhythm, clean masonry lines, and restrained ornamentation give Brink Hall a grounded elegance—quietly expressive of its era and purpose.

Archie Phinney Hall - 1938

Archie Phinney Hall was originally named Chrisman Hall and opened in 1938 as an expansion of the men’s dormitory Willis Sweet Hall, providing housing for 111 male students with a shared kitchen. Designed by Hugh Richardson of Lewiston to complement the earlier building’s style by Whitehouse & Price, it was built by Howard S. Wright Company with funding from regents’ and local bonds. Renamed in 1987 to honor Nez Perce anthropologist Archie Phinney, the building has housed the Anthropology and Sociology Department, the Sociology-Anthropology Museum, and various academic offices. As of 2024, it serves as the home of the Department of Culture, Society and Justice.

Physically, Archie Phinney Hall is a four-story, L-shaped masonry building featuring Collegiate Gothic style with simple Arts and Crafts influences. It has a gabled-belcast wood shingle roof and burnt red brick walls accented by clinker bricks. The windows are mainly six-over-six sash, arranged symmetrically except for the elevator tower addition from 1999. The building sits on a grassy hillside with a concrete retaining wall and parking area nearby.
