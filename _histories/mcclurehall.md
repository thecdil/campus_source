As the University of Idaho entered the 1990s, the College of Mines was scattered across seven locations on campus. The last building constructed specifically for the college—the “New” Mines Building—dated to 1961. The university prioritized the construction of a new facility in response to growing needs, breaking ground in 1993.[^1]   

The 70,000-square-foot building was named for U.S. Senator and university alumnus James A. McClure, recognized for his contributions to natural resource development. Completed in early 1995, the $11.8 million project was funded through federal, state, and private sources. McClure Hall initially housed the Departments of Metallurgical and Mining Engineering and Geography, as well as the Strategic Resources Lab, teaching labs, faculty and graduate offices, conference spaces, and a 75-seat lecture hall. After the College of Mines and Earth Resources closed in 2002, the building was repurposed for the College of Engineering and College of Science.[^2]

### Design  

McClure Hall reflects a Postmodern design with Contemporary influence. The tripartite composition incorporates color, material, and massing contrasts to emphasize both modern function and visual interest. Decorative and structural elements such as cast concrete cornices and metal detailing articulate the design while integrating mechanical and educational uses. Prominent bay projections and a stair tower contribute to the building’s sculptural quality and distinguish it within the academic core of campus.[^3]

### Physical Description  

The 3.5-story, steel-reinforced concrete structure includes a full basement and features a generally rectangular form. The building sits on a smooth-dressed concrete slab and is clad in red-pressed and grey brick veneer with cast concrete accents. The roof combines a truncated hip with a flat penthouse section and includes four cylindrical exhaust chimneys. Four prominent projections on the south elevation are faced with copper-colored anodized aluminum bays and framed by cast-concrete bases and cornices. These elements repeat in a curved projection on the east side and a stair tower on the north elevation. The fenestration includes untrimmed sash windows, concrete-trimmed pairs, and trabeated openings with grey brick lintels. Arch-radiating brick voussoirs mark the ground-level projections, while cast concrete and metal detailing further define the building’s exterior.[^4]

James A. McClure (1924–2011) earned his law degree from the University of Idaho in 1950 and became a prominent alumnus and U.S. Senator. He served Idaho in the U.S. House of Representatives (1967–1973) and in the Senate (1973–1991), advocating for natural resource development and legal education.[^5] University planning led to the construction of a new facility—named McClure Hall in his honor—which opened in 1995 to house the College of Mines. McClure and his wife Louise remained active university supporters, serving on the College of Law Advisory Board and other campus foundations.[^6] In 2001, they established the James and Louise McClure Endowment for the Sciences and Public Policy, reinforcing their legacy at the university.[^7]
