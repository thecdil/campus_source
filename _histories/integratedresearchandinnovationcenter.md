The Integrated Research & Innovation Center (IRIC) was completed in 2016 as a cross-disciplinary facility supporting collaborative research for all University of Idaho colleges.

The $52 million, 78,500-square-foot building was designed to accommodate flexible, evolving workspaces with interconnected, reconfigurable circulation. Intended to foster innovation across disciplines, the IRIC also represented a significant departure from the university’s traditional architectural language, though its designers incorporated red-pressed brick to harmonize with earlier campus buildings.

The facility achieved LEED Gold certification, reflecting its environmentally conscious design and construction.[^1]

### Design

The IRIC was designed in a 21st-century Modern style. It emphasizes rectilinear geometry, contemporary materials, and a flat roofline. Its layout and structural systems support adaptable interior spaces that can be reconfigured over time to meet changing research needs. Red-metal cladding and red-pressed brick reference the university’s historical material palette, blending the building into its campus context while also asserting a distinctively modern identity.[^2]

### Physical Description

The building is a 3.5-story, rectangular-form structure with curtain wall fenestration on the east façade. Red-metal cladding, glass, and red-brick masonry combine to create a visual link to surrounding buildings. The structure rests on a reinforced concrete foundation built into the hillside and includes balconies on the second and third floors, concrete staircases, and glass-and-metal doors.[^3]
