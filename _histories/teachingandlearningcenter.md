The Teaching and Learning Center (TLC), originally known as the University Classroom Center (UCC), opened in 1965 as a classroom facility with enclosed interior classrooms and open-air hallways. It was the only example of exposed-concrete Brutalist style construction on campus, notable for its west-facing sculptural shading elements reminiscent of Le Corbusierâ€™s Chandigarh Judicial Building in Northern India. In 2003, the UCC was closed for a major renovation and reopened in 2005 as the TLC. The remodel enclosed the exterior corridors, added a connection to the adjacent Student Union Building (1999), and introduced Northwest Regional Style design elements. Today, the TLC serves as a hub for general-use classrooms at the University of Idaho.

The renovated structure is a three-story, rectangular-form Postmodern design, distinguished by red stretcher-bond brick, a recessed curtain wall on the west elevation, and a flat primary roof. A shed roof supported by angled steel beams shades the large west-facing window walls. Windows are fixed-sash with plain trim and no sills; doors are glass with metal frames.
