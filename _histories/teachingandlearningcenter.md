The Teaching and Learning Center (TLC) originally opened in 1964 as the University Classroom Center (UCC). The UCC was a classroom facility with enclosed interior classrooms and open-air hallways. The building represented the only example of exposed-concrete Brutalist construction on campus, notable for its west-facing sculptural shading elements. In 2003, the UCC closed for a major renovation and reopened in 2005 as the TLC. The remodel enclosed the exterior corridors, added a connection to the adjacent Student Union Building (1999), and introduced Northwest Regional Style design elements. The TLC currently functions as a hub for general-use classrooms at the University of Idaho.[^1] 

### Design

The renovated structure follows a three-story, rectangular-form Postmodern design. The exterior combines references to Brutalist and Northwest Regional styles. Red stretcher-bond brick clads the façade, and a recessed curtain wall emphasizes the west elevation. A shed roof supported by angled steel beams shades the large west-facing window walls.[^2]  

### Physical Description

The building has a flat primary roof. Windows are fixed-sash with plain trim and no sills. Doors are glass with metal frames. Interior classrooms and corridors were reconfigured during the 2003–2005 renovation to support flexible general-use classroom layouts.[^3]
