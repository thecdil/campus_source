Forney Hall was constructed in 1923–1924 as a women’s dormitory, originally housing 120 students. It served in that role for nearly 40 years before being remodeled in 1971 to accommodate university office spaces, reflecting a shift in student housing to larger complexes on the northwest side of campus. Today, Forney Hall contains a testing center, administrative offices, academic institutes, and a guest residence facility. The building is named for Mary E. Forney, a respected figure in the Moscow community and wife of Judge James H. Forney, a university regent and its first acting president.

Architecturally, Forney Hall is a Collegiate Gothic-style building, three stories tall with a mission brick exterior and a reinforced concrete foundation over a basement and sub-basement. It features an I-shaped gabled roof with wooden shingles, prominent front-facing gables, and a striking brick entrance tower topped with a crown and light well. The tower is visually balanced by two chimneys to the south, reinforcing its stately and symmetrical design.
