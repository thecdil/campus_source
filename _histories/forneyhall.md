Forney Hall was constructed in 1923–1924 as a women’s dormitory, originally housing 120 students. It served in that role for nearly 40 years before being remodeled in 1971 to accommodate university office spaces, reflecting a shift in student housing to larger complexes on the northwest side of campus. Forney Hall was followed closely by [Hays Hall](/digital/campus/buildings/hayshall), forming a shared courtyard and cohesive architectural complex. Today, Forney Hall contains a testing center, administrative offices, academic institutes, and a guest residence facility. The building is named for Mary E. Forney, a respected figure in the Moscow community and wife of Judge James H. Forney, a university regent and its first acting president.[^1]

### Design
Forney Hall exhibits the Collegiate Gothic style seen across campus. Its architectural character includes a main arched doorway, brick exterior, and gabled roof. A striking brick entrance tower crowned with a light well accentuates the façade. The entrance tower is visually balanced by two chimneys to the south, reinforcing the stately and symmetrical design of the structure.[^2]

### Physical Description
The brick building rests on a reinforced concrete foundation over a basement and sub-basement. The front-facing gabled roof is clad with wood shingles. Forney hall features a mix of original and updated windows and doors. [^3] 

### Mary E. Forney
 Mary Emma (Belknap) Forney was a prominent figure in Moscow’s social and civic life and played an instrumental role in the establishment of the Moscow Public Library, securing funding through correspondence with Andrew Carnegie. After marrying James H. Forney and moving to Moscow, she became involved in community development and supported the university’s growth. Her contributions reflect a lasting legacy in both the city and the University of Idaho.[^4]
