The College of Natural Resources Building (CNR) was designed by the Boise firm Hummell, Hummell, Jones & Shawver and completed in 1972 to serve the growing needs of the College of Forestry, Wildlife, and Rangeland Sciences (CFWR). The college’s roots trace back to a forestry department founded in 1909, gaining autonomy in 1917 and eventually reorganized under the CFWR name in 1963. Previously housed in Morrill Hall, the program long required expanded and updated space. After years of advocacy by the New Building Committee—first chaired by John Howe, then Frank Pitkin—the university secured nearly $3.5 million in funding from federal, state, and Regents’ sources. The new facility provided classrooms, departmental offices, teaching and research laboratories, and space for faculty and graduate students. The CNR Building supported the university’s land-grant mission and reflected the institutional prioritization of agriculture, natural resources, and technical education.

A three-story, rectangular-form building with a rebar frame and concrete block masonry, the CNR Building features red, brown, and black stretcher-bond brick complemented by exposed aggregate concrete and wood. The flat roof is a coffered concrete slab. Its west elevation includes a monumental concave concrete wall clad in vertical wood slats, accessed by wide steps leading to an open veranda; the east side mirrors this form with a second-floor balcony that functions as a pedestrian overpass. A curtain wall on the north elevation incorporates alternating wood and glass panels set in metal muntins beneath a deep overhang supported by concrete columns. Additional entrances feature convex wood-clad vestibules and wood-paneled walls, evoking the building’s forestry focus. Timber and plywood products—used extensively as exterior elements—are character-defining features that communicate the building’s function. Entrances are primarily metal and glass, with some metal utility doors.
