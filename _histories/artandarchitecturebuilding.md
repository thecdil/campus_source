title: Art and Architecture Building

Known since around 2001 as the Art & Architecture Building, this structure was originally part of a wave of campus expansion following the 1906 fire that destroyed the Old Administration Building. Designed to support the School of Mines, it initially housed equipment such as “crushers . . . rolls, jigs, concentrators and magnetic separators” for ore processing. However, shortly after the building’s completion, flotation methods replaced the gravity-based techniques it had been built to accommodate, quickly rendering its vast interior space outdated.

As post–World War II enrollment surged, the university reassessed how best to utilize the underused facility. In 1950, President Buchanan authorized a “complete overhaul job,” noting that the building was “about to lose its long-held distinction as a space waster.” Following renovations, the structure was redesignated as the new Mines Building and became home to both the School of Mines and the Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology.

This function continued until 1960–61, when a new, distinctly modern Mines Building was constructed. Over the next decade, the original building saw a series of new occupants: it briefly hosted Art and Architecture classes, later housed the Entomology Department, and was ultimately reassigned to the Department of Psychology. At that time, it was renamed the Psychology Building and used for departmental offices, classrooms, and laboratories. Around 2001, the building underwent its final major transformation and was repurposed as the Art & Architecture Building, the role it serves today.
