title: Art and Architecture Building

Known as the Art & Architecture Building since around 2001, this structure has had a long and varied history on campus. It was originally built as part of a wave of expansion after the 1906 fire that destroyed the Old Administration Building. Designed to support the School of Mines, it was equipped with machinery like “crushers . . . rolls, jigs, concentrators and magnetic separators” for ore processing.[1] But not long after it was completed, newer flotation methods replaced the older gravity-based techniques the building was designed for—quickly making its large interior outdated.

With student enrollment booming after World War II, the university looked for better ways to use the underutilized space. In 1950, President Buchanan approved a “complete overhaul job,” joking that the building was “about to lose its long-held distinction as a space waster.”[2] After renovations, it was renamed the Mines Building and became home to both the School of Mines and the Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology.

This setup lasted until 1960–61, when a new, more modern Mines Building was built. Over the next ten years, the original structure hosted a rotating cast of departments: it briefly housed Art and Architecture classes, then the Entomology Department, and eventually the Department of Psychology. At that point, it was renamed the Psychology Building and used for offices, classrooms, and labs. Around 2001, the building found its current identity as the Art & Architecture Building—a role it continues to serve today.
