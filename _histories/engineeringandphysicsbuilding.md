title: Engineering and Physics Building
---

The Engineering and Physics Building was developed to meet the Physics Department’s space needs and officially opened in 1995 after two years of construction. It supports the Engineering Outreach Program, hosts mechanical and agricultural engineering classes, and houses the Physics Department as well as the National Center for Advanced Transportation Technology. This building continues the university’s expansion of engineering facilities that began in the early 20th century following the establishment of the College of Engineering in 1907.

The “L”-shaped, four-story building features a foundation of concrete, a metal roof, metal-trimmed windows, and metal-and-glass doors. Its exterior is primarily red-pressed brick laid in stretcher bond consistent with the campus motif. The design combines Postmodern elements, such as a gabled roof and parapet ends, with Modern features like a smooth-dressed Sullivanesque-style lower level and rectilinear window patterns. The layout allows ample daylight in interior spaces while limiting windows on the north and east elevations. The building includes a large auditorium, lecture halls, classrooms, offices, labs, and storage.
