As one of the first large residence halls on campus, Carol Ryrie Brink Hall (originally Willis Sweet Hall) was instrumental in shaping student life at the University of Idaho. Its construction in the mid-1930s was part of a bold campus expansion made possible through a university-led bond program; a creative solution to minimal state funding during the Great Depression. [^1]

Students housed here benefitted from a highly efficient kitchen that could serve a full dining room in under three minutes, thanks to features like a 17-foot steam table and a soapless dishwashing system. The hall’s reputation for innovation drew national attention. [^2] Colleges from across the country sent representatives to view this state-of-the-art kitchen and "to study its novel features and operation."[^3] 

Carol Ryrie Brink Hall is a four-story, L-shaped brick building designed in the Collegiate Gothic style, with subtle Arts and Crafts elements. The main entrance to the hall is a handsome gothic arched doorway at the apex of the building. Built prior to [Archie Phinney Hall](/digital/campus/buildings/archiephinneyhall), it served as a template for the later structure, sharing design features such as its steep, gabled roof and its use of dark red brick. The building’s symmetrical facade is composed largely of six-over-six sash windows. Brink Hall's understated ornamentation along with the clean lines and cohesive materials of its design reflect early 20th-century academic architecture in Idaho. [^3]

The building has endured challenges, including a 1956 arson incident that caused significant damage. The fire was caused by a student reporter who was later sentenced to a 25 year term in prison. [^4] In 1982, it was renamed for author Carol Ryrie Brink, an Idaho native and university alumna known for writing vividly about her home state.[^5]

Carol Ryrie Brink (1895–1981), born and raised in Moscow, Idaho, was a prolific author of over thirty books—both for children and adults—including the 1936 Newbery Medal–winning *Caddie Woodlawn*. [^6]  

During her time at the University of Idaho (1914–1917), she contributed to The Argonaut student newspaper and Gem of the Mountains yearbook, before transferring to UC Berkeley and graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1918. [^7] Her deep ties to the university were honored in 1965 with an honorary doctorate in letters, and in 1982, after her death, the historic Willis Sweet Hall was renamed *Carol Ryrie Brink Hall* to celebrate her legacy.[^8]  
### Willis Sweet

Willis Sweet (1856–1925) greatly aided the establishment of the University of Idaho in Moscow. Sweet was a lawyer, newspaper editor, and rising political figure in the late 1880s, and he personally drafted the legislation (alongside legislator John W. Brigham) that led to the university’s creation. Sweet successfully lobbied the territorial legislature while still in his pajamas to get the bill passed the next morning. [^9] Sweet went on to serve as the first president of the university’s Board of Regents and remained deeply involved in its early governance and identity. [^10]
