Carol Ryrie Brink Hall - 1937

As one of the first large residence halls on campus, Carol Ryrie Brink Hall (originally Willis Sweet Hall) played a key role in shaping student life at the University of Idaho. Its construction in the mid-1930s was part of a bold campus expansion made possible through a university-led bond program—an inventive solution to limited state funding during the Great Depression. 

Students housed here benefitted from a highly efficient kitchen that could serve full capacity in under three minutes, thanks to features like a 17-foot steam table and a soapless dishwashing system. The hall’s reputation for innovation drew national attention, prompting visits from other institutions hoping to study its design. 

Carol Ryrie Brink Hall is a four-story, L-shaped brick building designed in the Collegiate Gothic style, with understated Arts and Crafts elements. The main entrance to the hall is a handsome gothic arched doorway at the apex of the building. Built prior to Archie Phinney Hall, it served as a template for the later structure, sharing key design features such as its steep, gabled roof clad in stone-coated metal and its use of dark red brick with scattered clinker accents. The building’s symmetrical facade is composed largely of six-over-six sash windows. Though modest in ornamentation, the building’s clean lines and cohesive materials reflect early 20th-century academic architecture in Idaho.

The building also endured challenges, including a 1956 arson incident that caused significant damage. In 1982, it was renamed for author Carol Ryrie Brink, an Idaho native and university alumna known for writing vividly about her home state.
