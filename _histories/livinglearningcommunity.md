The Living Learning Community (LLC) was designed to meet increasing demand for on-campus housing as existing space became insufficient. The university had resorted to housing students in hotels, modified lounges, and repurposed dining hall areas while permanent solutions were developed. The LLC, completed in two phases between 2003 and 2004 and designed by Design West Architects P.A., provided 202,000 square feet of new residence space with 600 beds and became a hub for immersive student experience. Its eight themed buildings—Gem, Syringa, Sage, Upham, CNR, Gault, Engineering, and Honors (Scholars)—include classrooms, offices, a dining hall, and a campus marketplace. LLC 3, designated the “Global Village,” accommodates international programs, military and veteran services, and student exchange initiatives. Built on the site of Gault-Upham Halls (1954–2003), the LLC carries a legacy shaped by tragedy: a 1956 arson fire in Gault Hall claimed the lives of three students, leading to state-wide investigation and reform. Funding for the LLC followed a bond model pioneered by the university in the 1920s, with repayment sourced from student room and board fees. As of 2024, the LLC continues to serve a diverse population of students seeking enriched academic and social experiences in a residential setting.

The complex consists of eight Postmodern, suite-style buildings arranged in a quadrangle. Each wood-frame, H-form building is clad in red-pressed brick laid in stretcher bonds, vinyl siding in clapboard pattern, and metal siding at the upper levels. LLC 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are four stories; LLC 2 and 3 are five. The taller buildings exhibit a tripartite expression, with rough-hewn brick bases, smooth-dressed brick bands, and vinyl-clad upper stories. Roofs are medium-hip forms with asphalt shingles, dormers, and two square cupolas. Window fenestration includes double-hung, four-sash vinyl windows with decorative mullions; those set in brick walls have header-bond brick slipsills. Entrances feature bracketed metal hoods above single-leaf doors with side panels and transoms. A one-story commercial wing—6th Street Marketplace—connects LLC 1 and 2 at ground level and houses retail space open to the public. A similar wing connects LLC 2 to LLC 3 and houses the Housing and Residence Life information center. The LLC was purposefully designed to provide students with communal kitchens, study spaces, and lounges—fostering academic success and social enrichment in an inclusive, supportive environment.
