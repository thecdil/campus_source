title: Art and Architecture North

The Art & Architecture North Building was established to meet the needs of a growing student body in the Art & Architecture Department during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Although the department was founded in 1926, it lacked a permanent home for over four decades, occupying various spaces across campus despite the university’s significant role in advancing the architectural profession in Idaho. The dedication of this facility on November 19, 1966, finally offered a consolidated location for classrooms, studios, labs, and faculty offices, as well as the department's administrative headquarters under the College of Letters, Arts, and Social Sciences.

The building is a 3.5-story, rectangular-form International Style structure with a partially below-grade lower level and a loft studio. It features steel-reinforced concrete construction, a flat roof with a shed-style clerestory for natural light, and exterior walls clad in stretcher-bonded red brick, except for the north elevation, which is defined by a three-story Bauhaus-inspired glass and metal curtain wall. Entrances are located on the lower north and first-story east elevations, with metal windowed doors. Window configurations include one- and two-sash units with transoms and mullions matching the curtain wall system. The west, south, and east façades are largely unadorned, with ivy present on the east wall and extending onto the curtain wall. A one-story woodshop, connected by a breezeway, sits directly east of the main building and was completed around the same time.
