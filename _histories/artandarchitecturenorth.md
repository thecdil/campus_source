title: Art and Architecture North
---

The Art & Architecture North Building was established to meet the needs of a growing student body within the Art & Architecture Department during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Although the department was founded in 1926, it lacked a permanent home for over four decades, occupying various spaces across campus despite the university’s significant role in advancing the architectural profession in Idaho. The dedication of this facility on November 19, 1966, finally offered a consolidated location for classrooms, studios, labs, and faculty offices, as well as the department's administrative headquarters under the College of Letters, Arts, and Social Sciences.

### Design
Art and Architecture North is an International Style building, notably featuring an impressive Bauhaus-inspired glass and metal curtain wall on its north elevation. The flat roof has an integrated shed-style clerestory designed to bring in natural light.[^2] It is one of the finest examples of International Style on campus, with its original unaltered curtain wall and design features intact. 

### Physical Description
The building is a 3.5-story, rectangular-form structure with a partially below-grade lower level and a loft studio. It features steel-reinforced concrete construction and a flat roof with a shed-style clerestory. The west, south, and east façades of the building are largely unadorned, with ivy growing on the east wall and extending onto the curtain wall. Entrances are located on the lower north and first-story east elevations, consisting of metal windowed doors. Window configurations include one- and two-sash units with transoms and mullions that coordinate with the curtain wall system.
It is connected to [Art and Architecture South](/digital/campus/buildings/artandarchitecturesouth) via a catwalk, added in 1976.[^3]   

Adjacent to the main structure, directly to the east, is a one-story woodshop connected by a breezeway. This woodshop was completed around the same time as the main building and serves as a functional extension of the department's facilities. [^4]
