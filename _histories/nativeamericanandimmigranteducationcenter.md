Originally constructed in 1935 as the Entomology Building, this modest structure has served a variety of educational purposes over its lifetime. It was first home to entomologist W.F. Barr, whose teaching and research laid the foundation for the university’s vast insect collection, which grew from just 10,000 to more than a million mounted specimens. Later, the building supported academic tutoring in math and statistics before becoming the Native American/Migrant Education Center, housing the College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP). This federally funded initiative provides academic and financial support to students from seasonal farmworker backgrounds, continuing the building’s long legacy of educational service and access.

Unlike the more imposing Collegiate Gothic-style halls built around the same time, the building reflects a more modest, Minimal Traditional style—a deliberate architectural choice that reflects the economic constraints and practical sensibilities of the Great Depression era. Small and rectangular, the two-story, wood-clad structure features a symmetrical layout with original sash windows and a central entrance. Minor updates, such as an accessibility ramp and a newer asphalt shingle roof, have not significantly altered its historic character. The building remains a quiet but meaningful testament to the university’s commitment to both academic innovation and inclusive support.
