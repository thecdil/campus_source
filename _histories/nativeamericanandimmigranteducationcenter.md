### History

The building was originally constructed in 1935 as the Entomology Building. It served as the workplace of entomologist W.F. Barr, whose teaching and research established the university’s insect collection, growing it from 10,000 to over one million mounted specimens. Later uses included academic tutoring in math and statistics. The building eventually became the Native American/Migrant Education Center, housing the federally funded College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP), which supports students from seasonal farmworker backgrounds. This continued the building’s legacy of educational service and access.[^1]  

### Design

The building reflects the Minimal Traditional architectural style, contrasting with the more elaborate Collegiate Gothic halls of the same era. This modest style responded to the economic constraints and practical needs of the Great Depression period.[^2]  

### Physical Description

The structure is small, rectangular, and two stories tall, with wood cladding. It features a symmetrical layout with original sash windows and a central entrance. Minor updates include an accessibility ramp and a newer asphalt shingle roof, which have not significantly altered its historic character.[^3]
