title: Gauss-Johnson Engineering Building and Laboratory
---

The resource known today as the Gauss-Johnson Engineering Building and Laboratory began as Kirtley Engineering Laboratory Unit No. 1, constructed with $149,102 appropriated by the Idaho State Legislature in 1941. Named for Charles Luther Kirtley—the university’s first engineering graduate and a member of its inaugural class—the building housed laboratories for mechanical and chemical engineering, hydraulics, and irrigation, along with classrooms and administrative offices necessary for accreditation.[1]

Following World War II, rising demand for higher education spurred a dramatic enrollment increase—up 290 percent between 1944–45 and 1946–47. Engineering enrollment alone reached 669 in fall 1946, doubling pre-war averages. This rapid growth led President J.E. Buchanan to initiate the most ambitious building campaign in university history, made possible by $3.5 million in state appropriations. Among the new construction was Kirtley Engineering Laboratory Unit No. 2, which helped meet the university’s expanding space needs and further developed the area designated as the “engineering block.”[2]

In 1968, the university renamed the two buildings: Unit No. 1 became the H.F. Gauss Mechanical Engineering Building, honoring the former department head; Unit No. 2 became the Johnson Electrical Engineering Laboratory, named for J. Hugo Johnson, former head of Electrical Engineering. The facilities were unified into a single structure during a 1999 renovation, which added a penthouse level and merged the buildings into what is now the GJEBL.[3]

### Design
The GJEBL stands as an early campus example of Modern architecture, signaling the transition from pre-war traditionalist styles toward a new, utilitarian ethos. Its rectangular form, minimal ornamentation, and emphasis on function reflect the evolving approach to institutional design. Though altered in 1999, the resource maintains design coherence through consistent materials, massing, and fenestration patterns.[4]

### Physical Description
The building comprises two floors, a penthouse level, and a full basement. Its structure consists of steel-reinforced concrete with a red-brick veneer laid in stretcher bond, while the penthouse level is sided in metal. A variety of window types and sizes appear across the elevations, often grouped in rectangular or square-pane arrangements with metal mullions. The west elevation features single- and double-leaf metal doors and two roll-up doors suitable for vehicles. The north elevation includes a two-panel glass entry door framed by decorative concrete masonry units and a basement-level double-leaf metal door.[5]

Entrances on the south are auxiliary, while the east elevation maintains a regular 18-pane window rhythm. A flat roof is bisected by a low-gable section above the penthouse. Minimal ornamentation includes modest horizontal banding of vertically oriented, header-bonded brick and block-letter signage over the main entries. A distinctive 27-pane transom above the west doorway echoes earlier Art Deco detailing. Most of the metal doors and windows appear original.[6]  

### Charles Luther Kirtley
![placeholder image for Charles Luther Kirtley](https://objects.lib.uidaho.edu/harvester/small/pg3_075a_sm.jpg)  

Charles Luther Kirtley (1872–1938) was an early graduate of the University of Idaho. He entered the university in 1893 and was one of the first four students to earn a degree in 1896, earning distinction not only for his academic achievements but also as a dedicated student-athlete—playing half-back on the inaugural football team and competing in track and field relay events. [7]  

After graduating, he pursued medical studies at Rush Medical School, completed an internship in Portland, and dedicated his career to practicing medicine in rural Idaho, particularly in Challis—a community he served until his death in 1938. [8] His legacy is honored on campus through the Charles L. Kirtley Engineering Laboratory, reflecting his personal and educational contributions to the university.[9]  

### Henry Fallenstein Gauss
Henry Fallenstein Gauss (1885–1968) was a distinguished professor and administrator at the University of Idaho, significantly contributing to the development of its engineering programs. He served as the head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering for several decades, playing a pivotal role in shaping the department's curriculum and research initiatives. Gauss was instrumental in the establishment of the Kirtley Engineering Laboratory, which later became the Gauss-Johnson Engineering Building and Laboratory, reflecting his lasting impact on the university's infrastructure and academic legacy.[10].

### J. Hugo Johnson. 
Dr. J. Hugo Johnson was the chair of the Electrical Engineering department at the University of Idaho circa 1960.[11]
