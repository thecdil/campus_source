title: Gauss-Johnson Engineering Building and Laboratory
---

Originally known as the Kirtley Engineering Laboratory, the facility was designed to support mechanical and chemical engineering labs, hydraulics, irrigation research, classrooms, and administrative offices—key components for securing accreditation. Funding for the initial building came through a 1941 state appropriation, with construction completing in 1942. Following a surge in post-World War II enrollment, an expansion was added in 1949 to accommodate growing demand, becoming part of the largest building program in the university’s history at that time. In 1968, the two buildings were renamed to honor prominent faculty: the H.F. Gauss Mechanical Engineering Building and the Johnson Electrical Engineering Laboratory. A 1999 renovation physically merged these two into the Gauss-Johnson Engineering Building and Laboratory (GJEBL), adding a penthouse level.

The 2.5-story structure, built of steel-reinforced concrete with a red brick veneer, features flat roofs with a low-gable section atop the penthouse. Window designs vary between rectangular panes on the west façade and square panes with metal mullions on the north and east sides, most of which appear original. Entrances on the north and west sides include metal doors, with decorative concrete paneling and block-letter signage marking key access points. The building’s modest ornamentation includes horizontal brick banding that frames windows and separates stories. This facility exemplifies the campus’s architectural shift from traditional pre-war styles toward Modernism, emphasizing utilitarian function alongside restrained design elements.
