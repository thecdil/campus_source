Ridenbaugh Hall is the University of Idaho’s oldest extant building. It was designed by one of the
Northwest’s most celebrated architects, W.R. Ritchie and commissioned under the administration of the
fourth university president, James Alexander MacLean. Construction began in 1901, and the hall was completed in 1902. 

The building originally served as a women’s
dormitory and mixed-use space that accommodated home economics classrooms. However, the university
has appropriated it for several functions during its lifetime, including transitioning it into a men’s
dormitory in 1927. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Today, Ridenbaugh Hall serves as gallery space for art students, music practice studios, and offices.
