Ridenbaugh Hall is the University of Idaho’s oldest extant building. W.R. Ritchie, one of the Northwest’s most celebrated architects, designed the hall, which was commissioned under the administration of the fourth university president, James Alexander MacLean. Construction began in 1901, and was completed in 1902. The building originally served as a women’s dormitory and mixed-use space that accommodated home economics classrooms. The university has appropriated it for several functions during its lifetime, including transitioning it into a men’s dormitory in 1927. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Today, Ridenbaugh Hall serves as gallery space for art students, music practice studios, and offices.[^1]

### Design 

The design of Ridenbaugh Hall reflects the architectural sensibilities of the early twentieth century and the formal style associated with W.R. Ritchie. Its arrangement and detailing convey the building’s role as a dignified residential and instructional space for students.[^2]

### Physical Description

Ridenbaugh Hall is a three-story masonry structure with a rectangular plan and symmetrical façade. The exterior features red brick walls with stone trim, a hipped roof, and evenly spaced windows. Decorative stone elements frame the main entrance, and a central gable adds emphasis to the front elevation. The building’s proportions and material palette contribute to its enduring presence on campus.[^3]

Mary E. Ridenbaugh (1857–1926) served as vice president of the University of Idaho’s Board of Regents from 1901 to 1907 and played a vital role in advancing women’s education at the university. She championed the creation of a dedicated women’s dormitory—Ridenbaugh Hall—completed in 1902 and the first U of I building named in honor of a female figure. Her advocacy facilitated the development of Idaho’s earliest domestic science programs, including cooking classes held in the building’s inaugural kitchen. Ridenbaugh also contributed significantly to civic life in Boise, helping to establish the Carnegie Library and serving as a founding member of the Columbian Club. Her legacy endures through structures, programs, and institutions that reflect her lifelong commitment to education and public service.[^4]
