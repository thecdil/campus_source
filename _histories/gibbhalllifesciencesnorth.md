title: Gibb Hall (Life Sciences North)
---

Gibb Hall was developed as an expansion to the Life Sciences South Building, providing an additional 56,500 square feet of space for the growing department. Occupied in 1985, it represented the largest single building expenditure in the university’s history at that time, with a total cost of $11.2 million. As of 2024, Gibb Hall houses bacteriology, biochemistry, and biology teaching and research laboratories. The building was named in 1993 for Dr. Richard D. Gibb, who served as university president from 1977 to 1989. During his tenure, Gibb implemented a nationally recognized core curriculum, secured a $7 million grant from NASA, expanded the Lionel Hampton School of Music, and supported the formation of the College of Art and Architecture.

The building reflects a Postmodern design with references to Gothic elements. It stands on a concrete foundation with a partially exposed basement on the east side and is clad in brick, concrete, and cast concrete. Recessed square windows with thick concrete slipsills and headers define the north and south elevations. Roof gables and trim feature triangular accents that visually connect the building to nearby historic structures, including the 1925 Life Sciences South Building. While its proportions align with its neighbor, Gibb Hall diverges stylistically through the expression of ductwork framed by corbelled arches, restrained fenestration, and simplified buttresses—elements that evoke earlier campus architecture with cleaner, more minimal lines.
