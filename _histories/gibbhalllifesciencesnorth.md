title: Gibb Hall (Life Sciences North)
---

Gibb Hall was developed as an expansion to the Life Sciences South Building, adding 56,500 square feet to accommodate the growing department. Occupied in 1985, it represented the largest single building expenditure in university history at that time, costing $11.2 million. As of 2024, Gibb Hall houses bacteriology, biochemistry, and biology teaching and research laboratories. The building was named in 1993 for Dr. Richard D. Gibb, university president from 1977 to 1989.[^1]

### Design
The building reflects a Postmodern design incorporating Gothic references. Its roof gables and trim include triangular accents that visually link it to nearby historic buildings, such as the 1925 Life Sciences South Building. Stylistic distinctions include expressed ductwork framed by corbelled arches, restrained fenestration, and simplified buttresses, which evoke earlier campus architecture with cleaner, minimal lines.[^2]

### Physical Description
Gibb Hall rests on a concrete foundation with a partially exposed basement on the east side and is clad in brick, concrete, and cast concrete. The north and south elevations feature recessed square windows framed by thick concrete slipsills and headers. Its proportions correspond to those of the adjacent Life Sciences South Building, maintaining contextual harmony.[^3]

Dr. Richard D. Gibb served as the 18th president of the University of Idaho from 1977 to 1989. Raised on a farm in Illinois, he earned advanced degrees in agriculture and economics before leading the university through major initiatives, including implementing a nationally recognized core curriculum, securing a $7 million NASA grant, expanding the Lionel Hampton School of Music, and supporting the formation of the College of Art and Architecture. Gibb Hall, named in his honor in 1993, reflects his lasting impact. Known for his approachability and love of gardening, he passed away in 1994 after battling liver cancer.[^4]
