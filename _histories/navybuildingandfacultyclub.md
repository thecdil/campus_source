title: Navy Building and Faculty Club
---

The Navy Building was constructed around 1941–42 during World War II. After the war,in 1945, it was converted into a Faculty Club which offered a lounge and beverage service operated by volunteer faculty. Popular among staff, it remained a hub of campus recreation until 1970, when it became a satellite Student Union Club serving coffee, soft drinks, and sandwiches. At the time it had limited electrical capabilites, and therefore did not include a full kitchen. In 2002, the building took on its current role as home to the VTD program. Although this more recent use represents a shift from its earlier functions, the building still retains much of its original character and reflects both wartime architectural trends and the broader trajectory of educational expansion at the University of Idaho.  

### Design
The building is a two-story, Colonial Revival-style frame structure with a symmetrical form. It features a gable roof and a second-story front porch, as well as six-over-six sash windows that reinforce the Colonial aesthetic. The overall design reflects the simplicity and functionalism associated with wartime construction while incorporating stylistic elements of a popular revival style.  

### Physical Description

The exterior of the building is clad in a combination of clapboard and vertical wood siding. A concrete slab foundation supports the wood-frame structure. Notable modifications include ADA accessibility upgrades and a later-added brick chimney. The building sits against a grassy hillside with a concrete retaining wall, and despite its evolving use, it continues to preserve the character of its original wartime construction.
