Constructed in 1924–1925 to meet surging demand for science education, the Life Sciences South Building—originally known as the Science Hall—was a direct response to overcrowded labs and growing enrollment in disciplines like botany, chemistry, and zoology. Spurred by the establishment of a Sigma Xi chapter and national recognition of its science programs, the University of Idaho lobbied the state legislature for funding. When the appropriation initially stalled, a wave of over 200 telegrams from students and supporters helped sway the Senate—an act that famously led author Rafe Gibbs to call the building “a monument to S.F.B. Morse,” inventor of the telegraph.

Designed by campus architect and professor Rudolph Weaver, the building became a key part of the university’s Collegiate Gothic architectural identity. It added over 64,000 square feet of classroom, lab, and office space for science instruction and research. The building was renamed the Life Sciences Building in 1964 and has continued to support teaching and research in biology, biochemistry, and related fields. After a lab fire in 1997 caused significant damage, the structure was restored the same year.

The three-story Collegiate Gothic building features red pressed brick, cast-stone detailing, a slate roof with dormers and gables, and prominent Gothic entrances. A major restoration in 2011 preserved its architectural integrity and earned the university the Moscow Preservation Commission’s Orchid Award for outstanding historic preservation and stewardship.
