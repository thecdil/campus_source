## History

The Life Sciences South Building was constructed in 1924–1925 to address surging demand for science education. Overcrowded labs and growing enrollment in botany, chemistry, and zoology prompted the university to seek funding from the state legislature. After the initial appropriation stalled, over 200 telegrams from students and supporters influenced the Senate’s approval, inspiring author Rafe Gibbs to call the building “a monument to S.F.B. Morse,” inventor of the telegraph.   

The hall was designed by campus architect and professor Rudolph Weaver. Initially known simply as Science Hall, the building was renamed the Life Sciences Building in 1964. It has continued to support teaching and research in biology, biochemistry, and related fields. A 1997 lab fire caused significant damage, but the building was restored that same year. A major restoration in 2011 preserved its architectural integrity and earned the university the Moscow Preservation Commission’s Orchid Award for outstanding historic preservation and stewardship.

### Design

The building reflects the university’s Collegiate Gothic architectural identity. Rudolph Weaver’s design added over 64,000 square feet of classrooms, labs, and office space to support science instruction and research. The design incorporates cast-stone detailing and prominent Gothic entrances that reinforce its historic style.  

### Physical Description

The three-story building features red pressed brick and a slate roof with dormers and gables. The façade includes cast-stone detailing around windows and doors. Gothic entrances emphasize verticality and historic character. Restoration efforts have maintained the building’s original materials and architectural features, preserving its role as a landmark of campus heritage.
