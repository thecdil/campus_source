The University of Idaho began developing the Kibbie-ASUI Athletic Center in 1971 on the site of the fire-damaged Neale Stadium. Plans for a new facility were already underway when Neale was condemned earlier that summer. The outdoor stadium reached completion in 1971, and the iconic barrel-arched roof was added in 1975, officially creating the Kibbie Dome—at the time, the first indoor football stadium for the university. The project was largely funded by alumnus William H. Kibbie. During the summer of 1975, construction crews erected the 32 timber trusses in just 24 working days, consuming over 1,000,000 board feet of lumber. In 1976, the American Society of Civil Engineers recognized the facility for its innovative use of wood, naming it one of the nation's outstanding engineering achievements. Over five decades, the Kibbie Dome has hosted a wide range of events, including football, track, gymnastics, concerts, rodeos, and commencement ceremonies. It remains the largest indoor space in Moscow and was renamed the P1FCU Kibbie Dome in June 2023. [^1] 

### Design

The building spans 410 by 498 feet in a monumental Quonset Hut–like form, enclosing a playing field and spectator seating under a vaulted roof with 150 feet of interior clearance—large enough to contain Theophilus Tower within. The arched roof system employs patented MICRO-LAM/Trus-Dek timber and steel trusses designed by UI alumnus Art Troutner. The east and west walls use four-foot-deep Trus-Joist beams on concrete supports. The roof features elastomeric coating over urethane insulation and plywood sheathing. Exterior renovations in 2011 replaced the original plywood walls with Kal-Wall translucent panels and aluminum siding, enhancing daylighting and fire resistance.[^2] 

### Physical Description

The foundation consists of reinforced concrete on steel pilings. Entrances include glass public doors, long entry bays, and metal service doors. The building’s key character-defining features include the dome’s vast timber structure, glowing Kal-Wall panels, and sheer scale—rendering it both an architectural and engineering landmark.[^3] 

### William H. Kibbie

William H. Kibbie (1918–1988) was a native of Bellevue, Idaho, graduating from Gannett High School. He briefly enrolled at the University of Idaho, where he played freshman football before leaving to begin a career in the construction industry. 

Kibbie went on to become a successful contractor and entrepreneur, developing a deep sense of loyalty to his alma mater despite not completing his degree. In the early 1970s, he pledged over $300,000 of financial support for a new athletic facility at the university, helping transform the partially built outdoor stadium into a fully enclosed indoor dome. 

His generosity enabled the completion of the iconic barrel-arched roof in 1975, making the Kibbie Dome the first indoor football stadium on the West Coast. In recognition of his role in the project, the dome was named in his honor. Kibbie was inducted into the Idaho Athletic Hall of Fame in 1986 for his contributions to sports and education in the state.[^4]
