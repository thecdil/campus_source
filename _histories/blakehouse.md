Originally known as Ethel Steel House, Blake House was completed in 1953 and contributed to the University of Idaho’s innovative tradition of cooperative student housing. Designed as a women’s dormitory, it featured modern amenities for its time—including a sprinkler system, incinerator with a garbage chute, fire escapes, and color-coordinated interiors. The building reflected a forward-thinking approach to student life, particularly for women, and became a model for functional, affordable campus living. It was named for Ethel Steel, a former member of the Board of Regents (1933-1946) and early advocate of cooperative housing. Steel spoke at the dedication, recalling initial doubts about the co-op model but affirming its success in expanding access to education. The building remained a women’s co-op until the 1980s, after which it was renamed Blake House and repurposed as administrative offices. Though its use changed, the structure retains integrity in most aspects.

Blake House is a four-story, International Style building with Prairie-style influences, including a hipped roof and strong horizontal lines. It sits partially below grade on a hillside and is constructed of wood frame over a reinforced concrete foundation. The exterior is clad in rusticated brick and wood clapboard. Windows and doors—aluminum and glass in various updated configurations—maintain the clean, unornamented aesthetic characteristic of post-war Modern architecture.
