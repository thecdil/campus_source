The Wallace Residential Center was developed during a university-wide construction campaign in the 1960s to meet the demands of a rapidly growing student population. Built in three phases between 1963 and 1967, the center consists of four wings—Ballard, Stevenson, Gooding, and Willey—each named after a significant figure or resource in Idaho, while the entire complex honors William H. Wallace, Idaho’s first territorial governor. The initial phase included the Ballard and Stevenson Wings, along with a cafeteria and housing offices. Gooding and Willey Wings followed in 1967. The complex introduced the first residential elevator on campus and served as an essential part of the university’s expanding residential infrastructure during the post-war boom in higher education.

Designed by architectural firm Wayland, Cline & Smull in the International Style, the complex includes four rectangular wings splaying out from a two-story central core that houses the dining and administrative spaces. The two southern wings are four stories high, each accommodating 212 students, while the two northern wings rise six stories and house 312 students each. The structure uses steel-reinforced concrete and includes a basement that functioned as a Cold War-era bomb shelter. A red-pressed brick exterior aligns with the broader campus aesthetic. The complex features a prominent two-story curtain wall on the main façade and glass-and-metal doors throughout. Wing windows include operable picture-frame styles for individual rooms and fixed panes between suites. The layout and design reflect a Modern architectural ethos, emphasizing functionality and modular living.
