Completed in 1904, the building now known as Art and Architecture South is the second-oldest surviving structure on campus. It was commissioned during the tenure of the university’s fourth president, James A. MacLean, and designed by prominent Idaho architect J.E. Tourtellotte. Tourtellotte employed an ornate, eclectic Romanesque Revival style that would come to define much of the university’s architectural character. Originally constructed to replace <a href="/digital/campus/buildings/armoryold.html">its rickety wooden predecessor</a>, the building first served as the University Gymnasium and housed the ROTC Armory. Following the construction of Memorial Gymnasium in 1928, it was repurposed as the Women’s Gymnasium, a role it maintained until the early 1970s and the implementation of Title IX. Afterward, the building was remodeled to accommodate studios and offices for the College of Art and Architecture. It was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
