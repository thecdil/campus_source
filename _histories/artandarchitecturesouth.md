title: Art and Architecture South
---

The building now known as Art and Architecture South is the second-oldest surviving structure on campus. It was completed in 1904,  commissioned during the tenure of the university’s fourth president, James A. MacLean, and designed by prominent Idaho architect J.E. Tourtellotte.
Originally constructed to replace [its rickety wooden predecessor](/digital/campus/buildings/armoryold), the building first served as the University Gymnasium and housed the ROTC Armory. Following the construction of Memorial Gymnasium in 1928, it was repurposed as the Women’s Gymnasium, a role it maintained until the early 1970s and the implementation of Title IX. Afterward, the building was remodeled to accommodate studios and offices for the College of Art and Architecture. It was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[1]
### Design
Idaho architect J.E. Tourtellotte designed the building in an intricately detailed, eclectic Romanesque Revival style that shaped much of the campus’s architectural identity. The rectangular structure measures 64 feet wide by 129 feet deep, with two stories and a basement. The main east façade rises above a wide flight of stairs and features a projecting masonry semi-circular barrel-arch with a large, mossy cast-stone keystone over the recessed entryway. Projections appear at the edges and centers of the north and south faces, as well as over the central east and west entrances. The foundation is squared, rock-faced basalt rubble atop a concrete slab, providing on-grade access at the north and west entrances. Timber-reinforced masonry forms the walls, finished in red brick complemented by white brick and cast stone masonry arches, coping, and sills. The roof has a medium-slope longitudinal hip with shouldered, flat-headed parapets, gabled dormers at the center of each edge, and hipped dormers over the corner projections. A central lantern tower, designed for ventilation and once accessible to personnel, was removed and replaced with a replica in 2010. Wooden trusses span the latitudinal axis beneath asphalt shingles and beige metal flashing. A 1976 renovation added a catwalk connecting this building to Art and Architecture North and inserted an interior floor above the gymnasium.[2] 
### Physical Description

The building is a sturdy rectangular structure featuring two stories above a basement. Its red brick walls are enhanced by white brick and cast stone detailing, emphasizing arches and window sills. The prominent east façade is marked by a broad stairway leading to a recessed entry framed by a semi-circular barrel-arch with a cast-stone keystone.

Roofing consists of a medium-pitched hip roof with gabled dormers centered on each side, hipped dormers on the corners, and a distinctive lantern tower for ventilation. The foundation’s basalt rubble gives the building a solid, grounded appearance and allows for accessible entrances on the north and west sides. The structure is supported internally by timber-reinforced masonry and wooden roof trusses, capped with asphalt shingles and metal flashing.[3]
