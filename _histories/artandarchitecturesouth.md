Built to replace <a href="/digital/campus/buildings/armoryold.html">its rickety wooden predecessor</a>, what is now known as Art and Architecture South served as the gymnasium and armory for the UI campus until 1928. After the <a href="/digital/campus/buildings/memorialgymnasium.html">Memorial Gymnasium</a> was built in 1928, the Art and Architecture South building served as the Women's Gym until the early 1970's and the advent of Title IX. The building was then remolded to serve as studios and office space for College of Art and Architecture faculty and students. In 1983, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
