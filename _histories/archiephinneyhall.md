Archie Phinney Hall - 1938

Archie Phinney Hall, originally named Chrisman Hall after Brigadier General Edward R. Chrisman, was constructed in 1938 as an addition to [Willis Sweet Hall](/digital/campus/buildings/carolryriebrinkhall) to provide supplemental dormitory space. 
Designed by Hugh Richardson of Lewiston and based on plans by Whitehouse & Price of Spokane, it was built by the Howard S. Wright Company of Seattle for $388,130, funded through regents’ and local bonds. 
Connected to Willis Sweet Hall via a shared kitchen, it provided housing for 111 male students.  

The hall was renamed in 1987 from Chrisman Hall to Archie Phinney Hall, for Nez Perce anthropologist Archie Phinney of Culdesac, Idaho. For a number of years the hall housed the Anthropology and Sociology Department, its museum, and related offices. 
As of 2024, it is home to the Department of Culture, Society and Justice.[1]

  Archie Phinney was born on September 4, 1904, in Culdesac, Idaho, and passed away on October 29, 1949, in Lewiston, Idaho, at the age of 45. He was the first Nez Perce to earn a B.A. from the University of Kansas and the first Plateau Indian to receive a Ph.D. He authored *Nez Perce Texts*, a significant contribution to the preservation of Nez Perce language and oral tradition. Phinney worked for many years with the Bureau of Indian Affairs at the North Idaho Agency and played a central role in the formation of the National Congress of American Indians. His career focused on improving conditions for the Nez Perce and advancing their status as a sovereign nation within the United States. Though he died young, his work had a lasting influence on Native advocacy, policy, and education. [3]
