Archie Phinney Hall - 1938

Archie Phinney Hall, originally named Chrisman Hall after Brigadier General Edward R. Chrisman, was constructed in 1938 as an addition to [Willis Sweet Hall](/digital/campus/buildings/carolryriebrinkhall) to provide supplemental dormitory space. 
Designed by Hugh Richardson of Lewiston and based on plans by Whitehouse & Price of Spokane, it was built by the Howard S. Wright Company of Seattle for $388,130, funded through regentsâ€™ and local bonds. 
Connected to Willis Sweet Hall via a shared kitchen, it provided housing for 111 male students. 
Renamed in 1987 for Nez Perce anthropologist Archie Phinney of Culdesac, Idaho, the building later housed the Anthropology and Sociology Department, its museum, and related offices. 
As of 2024, it is home to the Department of Culture, Society and Justice.


Physically, Archie Phinney Hall is a four-story, L-shaped masonry building featuring Collegiate Gothic style with simple Arts and Crafts influences. It has a gabled-belcast stone coated metal roof and burnt red brick walls accented by clinker bricks. The windows are mainly six-over-six sash, arranged symmetrically except for the elevator tower addition from 1999. The building sits on a grassy hillside with a concrete retaining wall and parking area nearby.
