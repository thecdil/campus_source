The Graduate Art Studio has served a range of university functions since its construction in 1918. Originally built as an engineering test laboratory, it was also the site of the first broadcasts of KUOI, the university’s student-run radio station. In more recent decades, it has provided dedicated studio space for graduate students in the visual arts, offering a place for creative exploration, practice, and development within the MFA program.[^1]

### Design
The building reflects early 20th-century industrial design, with a dual-rectangular footprint and utilitarian form typical of the factory and warehouse buildings of its era in Idaho.[^2]

### Physical Description
It is constructed of reinforced concrete with a brick veneer, includes partial wood framing, and features a basement, two floors, and a raised loft. A clerestory runs the length of the roof, flanked by shed-roofed wings.[^3]
