The University of Idaho Library began in the Administration Building, which was destroyed by fire in 1906. A new collection space in the rebuilt structure served students for several decades. Growing enrollment and expanding research needs by the mid-20th century created demand for a purpose-built library. Planning for the new facility started in 1950. The library, designed by Ernest Price of Whitehouse, Price, Deneff, and Deeble, opened in 1957 to serve the campus and community. A major expansion occurred in 1991 with the addition of nearly 70,000 square feet to the north. This $12.3 million project introduced a five-story tower, relocated the main entrance, and incorporated design elements referencing the campus’s Gothic traditions. Despite changes to the original setting and style, the building continues as the university’s primary academic library.[^1] 

### Design

The core structure consists of four stories and a basement, constructed of reinforced concrete with a brick façade and flat roof. The building’s form is an irregular square and reflects the International Style. The 1991 Postmodern addition added a five-story tower on the northeast corner and a new wing along the north elevation. The addition retains the red brick veneer and incorporates references to Gothic architecture. The main entrance moved to the north side and features two sets of double doors with metal frames and plate glass. Horizontal rows of windows, particularly on the north elevation, use single-sash aluminum frames arranged in a grid pattern reminiscent of Aldo Rossi’s architectural vocabulary. The northeast corner contains a convex, glass-fronted atrium known as the “Fishbowl.”[^2]  

### Physical Description

The east, south, and west elevations remain largely without windows, maintaining the stark character of the original design. The building’s brick façade presents a uniform red color that ties both the original and addition visually. The flat roof caps the structure with minimal overhang. The five-story tower rises prominently on the northeast corner, defining the library’s profile on campus. The “Fishbowl” atrium adds a curved glass element contrasting the building’s predominantly rectilinear forms. The north elevation’s window bands provide natural light and visual interest, breaking the solidity of the brick walls.[^3]
