Morrill Hall was constructed in 1906 and stands as one of the University of Idaho’s oldest surviving buildings. Architect Henry Nelson Black designed the building in the Classical Revival style. Funding came partly from insurance money after the original Administration Building was destroyed by fire. The building, costing $55,907, served as a temporary facility until a new administration building was constructed. The fourth floor was added in 1930. Morrill Hall originally housed the College of Agriculture and later accommodated the School of Mines, the Forestry Department, and currently the College of Graduate Studies. The building was named in honor of Representative Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont, a key advocate for the 1862 Morrill Act, which provided federal lands to fund public universities focused on agriculture and mechanical arts.[^1] 

### Design

The building exhibits Classical Revival style elements typical of the early 20th century. Its design reflects academic seriousness and institutional permanence, consistent with land-grant university traditions. The building’s brick-and-stone construction and symmetrical form embody this architectural language.[^2] 

### Physical Description

Morrill Hall is a four-story structure measuring over 28,000 square feet. The primary materials are brick and stone. The 1930 addition of the fourth floor expanded the original three-story design. The building’s massing and detailing convey its historic purpose and importance within the university campus.[^3]
