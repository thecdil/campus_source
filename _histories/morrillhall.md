Constructed in 1906, Morrill Hall is one of the University of Idaho’s oldest surviving buildings. Designed by architect Henry Nelson Black in the Classical Revival style, the building was funded in part by insurance money received after the original Administration Building was destroyed by fire. At a cost of $55,907, the four-story brick-and-stone structure—measuring over 28,000 square feet—was initially built as a temporary solution until a new administration building could be constructed. The fourth floor was added in 1930.

Originally serving as the home of the College of Agriculture, Morrill Hall later accommodated the School of Mines, the Forestry Department, and, eventually, the College of Graduate Studies, which it continues to house today. The building was named in honor of Representative Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont, a key figure behind the 1862 Morrill Act. This legislation enabled the federal government to allocate lands—often formerly held by Indigenous peoples—to fund the establishment of public universities focused on agriculture and the mechanical arts. As a result, many land-grant institutions, like the University of Idaho, feature buildings named in his honor.
