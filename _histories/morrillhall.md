The University of Idaho's Morrill Hall (commonly just Morrill) is one of the campus's oldest structures.  Morrill was built in 1906 with insurance money gained from the destruction of <a href="/digital/campus/buildings/administrationbuildingold.html">Old Admin</a>. It served to tide the University over until funds could be gathered to build the <a href="/digital/campus/buildings/administrationbuildingnew.html">New Admin</a>. Built at a cost of $55, 907, Morrill is a four-story, brick and stone, rectangular construction of 28,246 feet. The fourth story was added in 1930. 

Morrill Hall was originally constructed as the University's agriculture building. It became the Forestry Building in 1950, but was eventually returned to being called Morrill Hall and presently houses the College of Graduate Studies.

Morrill Hall is named after Senator Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont, whose name adorns the 1862 bill that President Lincoln signed to provide funds for a series of land-grant colleges. Senator Morrill fought for this bill for many years, which lead to it becoming known as the Morrill Act. Consequently, it is not uncommon to see a landmark or building named for Morrill on land-grant campuses.
