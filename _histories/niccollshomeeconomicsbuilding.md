title: Niccolls Home Economics Building
---

The Niccolls Home Economics Building served as a central hub for home economics education at the University of Idaho, supporting a growing student body and advancing the land-grant mission to provide practical, accessible instruction in domestic and consumer sciences. From its founding, the university was coeducational, and home economics represented an important academic and career pathway for women. The Department of Domestic Sciences (later Home Economics) was established in 1902 and operated without a permanent home for five decades. In 1951, a new building was completed on the site of the condemned Engineering Building, offering modern classrooms and laboratories for courses in clothing and textiles, interior design, housing, child development, and family studies. Although widely known as the Niccolls Building, it was not officially named until 1962, when alumna Mary Hall Niccolls bequeathed a $450,000 scholarship fund to the university in gratitude for the small scholarship that had enabled her own education in 1906.

The four-story, rectangular structure reflects a later phase of Collegiate Gothic architecture on campus. Constructed of reinforced concrete and steel with brick veneer, it features offset gables and a center gable over the main entry. The prominent entrance includes sandstone two-centered arches with ornate floral reliefs and stylized fabric motifs flanking “Home Economics” carved in illuminated manuscript-style lettering. Decorative brickwork, metal and glass doors, multi-sash windows with metal muntins, and quoins enhance the façade. A smaller, matching archway frames a secondary door to the east, and a segmental arch frames another entry on the south side. An elevator tower was added around 1980.
