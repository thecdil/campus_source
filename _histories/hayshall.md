### History

Completed in 1927 as an extension of [Forney Hall](/digital/campus/buildings/hayshall), Hays Hall was designed to accommodate the growing number of women students at the University of Idaho. Housing around 125 women, it featured large sleeping porches and private rooms. Over the decades, the building adapted to meet changing campus needs. A minor fire in 1954 tested its “fireproof” reputation but caused only moderate damage. In 2025, additional evidence of fire damage was discovered in the roofing timbers, leading to a complete rebuild of the roof. The ground floor was converted into offices in 1971, and the upper floors were transformed into compact student apartments. Today, Hays Hall serves a variety of university functions, including housing the alumni office, residence center, and Naval ROTC offices. It is also home to the Leila Old Historic Costume Collection, which holds more than 10,000 items. The building is named for Gertrude L. Hays, a dedicated advocate for education who served on the Idaho Board of Regents from 1906 to 1913.[^1]

### Design

Hays Hall reflects the Collegiate Gothic style, displaying simpler ornamentation than Forney Hall but maintaining a complementary character. The design closely relates to its counterpart, sharing similar materials and forms while projecting a slightly more restrained architectural expression.[^2]

### Physical Description

The six-story structure combines brick and stucco with arched doorways framed by carved stone details. Original multi-lite metal windows punctuate the façade, and decorative rafter tails enhance the roofline. Together with Forney Hall, Hays Hall forms a cohesive complex, unified by matching rooflines and a shared courtyard.[^3]

### Gertrude L. Hays

Gertrude L. Hays, wife of former Idaho attorney general and Boise mayor Samuel H. Hays, was deeply involved in civic and educational causes. She served as secretary of the University of Idaho Board of Regents, held a position on the Idaho Free Library Commission, and helped establish the Idaho Chautauqua movement in 1893—roles that reflected her active participation in club and community work.[^4]
