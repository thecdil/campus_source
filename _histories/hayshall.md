Completed in 1927 as an extension of Forney Hall, Hays Hall was designed to accommodate the growing number of women students at the University of Idaho. Housing around 125 women, it featured large sleeping porches and private rooms. Over the decades, the building adapted to meet changing campus needs. A minor fire in 1954 tested its “fireproof” reputation but caused only moderate damage. In 1971, the ground floor was converted into offices, and the upper floors were transformed into compact student apartments. Today, Hays Hall serves a variety of university functions, including housing the alumni office, residence center, and Naval ROTC offices. It is also home to the Leila Old Historic Costume Collection, which holds more than 10,000 items. The building is named in honor of Gertrude L. Hays, a dedicated advocate for education who served on the Idaho Board of Regents from 1906 to 1913.

Architecturally, Hays Hall reflects the Collegiate Gothic style, with simpler ornamentation than Forney Hall but a complementary design. Its six-story brick and stucco façade features arched doorways with carved stone details, original multi-lite metal windows, and decorative rafter tails. Together, Hays and Forney create a cohesive complex, unified by matching rooflines and a shared courtyard.
