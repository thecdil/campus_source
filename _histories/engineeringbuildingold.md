title: Engineering Building (Old)
---

Built in 1906, the Old Engineering Building was one of the University of Idaho's original structures. Over the years, the building has housed the Applied Science Department and the School of Mines, as well as engineering classrooms, offices, and labs. In 1951, it was razed due to unsafe conditions within the building. Because of the structure's age and service to many, now preeminent, engineering programs, pieces of the building were preserved as benches and placed at the foot of the <a href="/digital/campus/items/campus03039.html">Memorial Steps</a> (built from the original steps of the Old Administration Building) as benches.
