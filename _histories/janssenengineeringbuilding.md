The Janssen Engineering Building (JEB) was completed in 1950 to replace the university’s original 1902 Engineering Building, which had been repeatedly condemned and declared “UNSAFE!” and “INADEQUATE!” by faculty. Rising enrollment and demand in engineering fields drove the need for a larger, more modern facility, and the JEB was one of several structures funded through a $3.5 million postwar expansion initiative. Originally called Engineering Classroom Unit 1, it provided administrative offices, classrooms, research and teaching labs, and an auditorium. The building was later renamed in honor of Allen S. Janssen, a former engineering student and longtime Dean of the College of Engineering (1946–1967). Its construction marked a significant turning point in the university’s architectural direction, signaling a move away from traditional prewar styles toward a bold embrace of International-Style Modernism.

The four-story, L-shaped structure is composed of steel-reinforced concrete, with a red brick veneer on the upper floors and rectilinear concrete paneling at the base. Horizontal ribbon windows with metal mullions define the primary elevations, providing generous natural light and expressing the streamlined aesthetic of midcentury Modern design. Entrances are recessed and framed in concrete paneling, with metal double-leaf doors and light-filled transoms. The building’s clean lines, window bands, and minimalist detailing exemplify the early Modernist vocabulary that reshaped the campus in the post–World War II era.
