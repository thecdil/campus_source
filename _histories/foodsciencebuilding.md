title: Food Science Building

The Food Science Building was developed in 1941–1942 to support dairy science classrooms, fermentation and bacteriology research labs, and later WAMI research and teaching facilities. State appropriations primarily funded its $103,750 cost, reflecting the university’s commitment to expanding food science education amid World War II. Over the years, the building has continued to serve scientific research and instructional purposes.

Blending Collegiate Gothic and Modern styles, the building features a flat roof alongside a terracotta Gothic archway entrance. Terra cotta-capped buttresses reinforce its Gothic appearance, while stretcher-bond masonry rests on a smooth, exposed concrete foundation. Windows with trefoil designs further emphasize the Gothic influence. Around 2017, an elevator and new stairs were added to the eastern entrance projection, carefully matching the building’s original brick tone.
