title: Food Science Building
---

The Food Science Building was constructed in 1941–1942 to support dairy science classrooms, fermentation and bacteriology research labs, and later WAMI research and teaching facilities. Its $103,750 cost was primarily funded by state appropriations, reflecting the university’s commitment to expanding food science education during World War II. The building has continued to serve scientific research and instructional purposes over the decades.[^1]

### Design
Blending Collegiate Gothic and Modern styles, the building incorporates elements from both traditions. Terra cotta-capped buttresses and a Gothic archway entrance reflect its Gothic sensibilities, while the overall form of the building and flat roof point to Modernist tendencies. Windows with trefoil detailing reinforce its stylistic ties to earlier campus buildings.[^2] 

### Physical Description

The structure is built with stretcher-bond masonry resting on a smooth, exposed concrete foundation. A flat roof tops the rectangular building, and a terracotta Gothic arch frames the main entrance. Around 2017, an elevator and new stairs were added to the eastern entrance projection, with brickwork carefully matched to the original tone to preserve visual continuity.[^3]
