The College of Education Building was designed by Hummel, Hummel, Jones & Shawver of Boise, Idaho, to serve the university’s expanding instructional needs. In 2016–2017, the building underwent a significant LEED Gold-certified renovation led by Seattle-based architectural firm Muller Hull. The remodel focused on sustainability and modernization, including expanded hallways, a rooftop break space, and substantial systems upgrades. Coffman Engineers reported structural, mechanical, and electrical renovations across 62,700 square feet, including asbestos remediation, heating supplied by the campus biomass plant, chilled water integration, and energy modeling verified over 12 months. Though exterior replacements remained sympathetic to the original aesthetic, the curtain wall was modified with more steel-framed windows to increase daylight access. The College of Education Building continues to support the university’s mission of instruction, having evolved alongside changing pedagogical and environmental priorities.

The five-story building has a reinforced concrete foundation set partially below grade and features above-grade construction of brick, steel, and glass. The brick is laid in a stretcher-bond pattern consistent with broader campus design. Two flat membrane-style roofs cover the fourth and fifth floors, with the fourth level offering a terrace for student use. A prominent curtain wall of steel-mullioned windows and panels dominates the exterior. This curtain wall was redesigned during the 2016–2017 renovation. The overall form and materials reflect traits typical of International Style design from the mid-20th century, though the alterations substantially impacted its earlier visual and architectural identity.
